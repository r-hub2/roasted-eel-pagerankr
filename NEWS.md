# pagerankr 0.1.1

* The test suite passes against rurl 3.1.0 as well as 3.0.1. rurl 3.1.0 adds
  `path_normalisation`, a British-spelling alias of `path_normalization`, to
  `rurl::get_clean_url()`, and the canonicalization surface guard in
  `test-canonicalization.R` failed on it by design. The guard now lists the
  alias as an optional argument: it counts as accounted for when the installed rurl has
  it and is never reported as removed when it does not. It cannot move the node
  key, because `canonical_profile()` pins `path_normalization` and rurl rejects
  both spellings together (`PAGE-lgsbjjuf`).

* `analyse_pagerank_grid()` and `sf_normalise_position()` are now exported as
  British-spelling aliases of `analyze_pagerank_grid()` and
  `sf_normalize_position()`. Each alias is the same function as its US-spelled
  primary and is documented on the primary's help page; the US spellings stay
  the canonical names (`SEOR-qwomlgjd`).

* Documentation prose is now US English throughout, matching `DESCRIPTION`'s
  `Language: en-US`: the help pages for `smooth_transitions()` and
  `transform_weights()` and the `README` function table no longer use British
  spellings, and `inst/WORDLIST` no longer accepts them. The message
  `compute_pagerank()` prints when `eps` or `niter` switches the solver to
  ARPACK now reads "honored" (`SEOR-kfiqpymb`).

* The documentation site's address is now the GitLab Pages namespace path
  <https://bart-turczynski.gitlab.io/pagerankr/>, the fleet-wide standard,
  instead of the project's unique Pages domain, which stops resolving once it
  is turned off. `DESCRIPTION`, `_pkgdown.yml`, `CITATION.cff`, `.zenodo.json`,
  `codemeta.json`, `SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml`, `.bestpractices.json` and the
  `README` badge all carry the new address. The CRAN page for 0.1.0 keeps the
  old address until the next release (`SEOR-vujgdjfv`).

* pagerankr is on CRAN. `DESCRIPTION`'s `URL:` now lists the CRAN page,
  <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pagerankr>, as do `CITATION.cff` and
  `codemeta.json`, and the `README` leads its installation instructions with
  `install.packages("pagerankr")` (`PAGE-gwgjmtmw`).

# pagerankr 0.1.0

* **`BugReports:` stays on `/-/issues`; every human-facing tracker link now
  points at `/-/work_items`.** CRAN runs two checks over a GitLab
  `BugReports:` URL and they contradict each other: `tools::check_url_db()`
  fetches the address and 404s on `/-/issues`, which GitLab replaced with a
  new work-items page, while `tools:::.check_package_CRAN_incoming()` never
  fetches anything and flags any path that is not a string match for
  `/-/issues` with a NOTE. Declaring `/-/work_items` in `DESCRIPTION` is not
  a style choice: it got the first pslr 1.2.1 upload archived at the CRAN
  pretest on 2026-09-12. So `DESCRIPTION` (and the roxygen2-generated
  `pagerankr-package` help topic, which mirrors it) keep `/-/issues`;
  `codemeta.json`, `SECURITY.md`, and `README` -- files a human actually
  clicks -- now point at `/-/work_items`, the address GitLab serves
  (`SEOR-ocbtrrnl`).

* **The GitHub Actions workflows are gone, and `codemeta.json` names GitLab.**
  `.gitlab-ci.yml` has replaced all eight workflows since the move to GitLab, so
  `.github/workflows/` and `.github/dependabot.yml` were dead weight that the new
  read-only GitHub mirror would have republished. `codemeta.json` now points at
  `gitlab.com` for every URL it carries -- repository, issue tracker, release
  notes and CI -- matching what `DESCRIPTION` has said since `PAGE-mehcgwzv` (`PAGE-yfmrrrhp`).

* **`BugReports:` points at `/-/issues`, the form the CRAN incoming
  check requires.** The incoming check on `R-devel` notes any `gitlab.com` `BugReports:`
  whose path is not `/-/issues`; a browser is redirected to `/-/work_items`.
  `README` and the generated `pagerankr-package` help topic follow
  (`PAGE-mehcgwzv`).

* **`rurl` now installs from CRAN; the `Remotes:` field is gone.** `rurl`
  reached CRAN as 3.0.1 on 2026-09-09, so `DESCRIPTION` no longer needs a
  `Remotes:` entry -- a field CRAN does not honor and which drew a NOTE on
  every `--as-cran` run. Every hard dependency now resolves from CRAN
  (`PAGE-agtgxupt`).

* **The declared `rurl` floor is `>= 3.0.1`, up from `>= 3.0.0`.** `rurl` went
  1.2.0 straight to 3.0.1 on CRAN and never published a 3.0.0, so the old floor
  named a version nobody could install -- the second time this package declared
  a minimum that existed nowhere. 3.0.1 is the lowest `rurl` that exists as a
  release and that the suite has been run against (`PAGE-tsbkxhoz`).

* **`canonical_profile()` now pins `credential_handling = "strip"`.** `rurl`
  3.0.1 added the argument. Userinfo is not part of a node key, but this knob
  decides whether a credentialed URL yields a key at all: the alternative,
  `"reject"`, returns `NA`, which `clean_url_columns()` keeps as its raw self
  and so turns every credentialed URL into an opaque node. `"strip"` is
  `rurl`'s current default, so no node key changes -- the pin freezes a default
  that could otherwise flip underneath the graph.

* **The package is now hosted on GitLab, and the install command has changed**
  to `devtools::install_gitlab("bart-turczynski/pagerankr")`. The previous
  `install_github()` form no longer resolves. Bug reports move to the GitLab
  tracker, and security reports are now made by email to the maintainer rather
  than through GitHub private vulnerability reporting (see `SECURITY.md`).

* **Convergence controls and `damping` now fail as documented instead of
  silently changing the request or raising an internal R error.** Three fixes,
  all at the public boundary of both `pagerank()` and `compute_pagerank()`:

  * A fractional `niter` is rejected. It was passed through `as.integer()`,
    so `niter = 2.7` became an iteration cap of `2` with nothing said. Values
    above `.Machine$integer.max` are rejected for the same reason: the
    coercion produced `NA` and reached the solver as a missing cap.
  * `damping = NA_real_` (and `NA_integer_`, `NaN`, `Inf`, `-Inf`) reports
    ``` `damping` must be a single numeric value between 0 and 1. ```
    `compute_pagerank()` tested `damping < 0` on an `NA`, so the `if` received
    `NA` and R raised "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed". Bare `NA` is
    logical and already produced the named error; only the typed missings and
    the infinities slipped through. Both entry points now share one validator.
  * A non-finite `eps` is rejected. `Inf` passed the `eps <= 0` test, and an
    infinite tolerance is not a tolerance.

* Added deterministic fixtures for graph shapes whose convergence and mass
  diagnostics were unpinned: disconnected components (a closed component holds
  exactly its share of the teleport vector; a dangling node moves mass across
  the component boundary), zero-weight edges (equivalent to no edge, with the
  target left on teleport mass alone), and the all-zero-weight graph (a named
  weight error).

* **Node identity moves off a presentation dial: `canonical_profile()` now pins
  `url_standard = "whatwg"` and `path_encoding = "keep"`.** This changes node
  keys. `path_encoding` is documented by `rurl` as a *presentation* knob whose
  `"decode"` value "may re-encode or decode reserved octets (so `%2F` may fold
  to a path-separating `/`)"; pagerankr had been using it as its identity
  function. Two consequences, both defects, are fixed:

  * An encoded slash is no longer folded into a path separator, so
    `http://example.com/a%2Fb` and `http://example.com/a/b` are two nodes
    rather than one. Same for `http://example.com/..%2fa`, which previously
    popped a segment it should not have.
  * Percent-encoded dot segments resolve again. `rurl` 3.0.0 stopped resolving
    them under the old pin by reordering decode after dot-segment removal, so
    `/%2e%2e/a` keyed to `/../a` instead of `/a`. Under `"whatwg"` the standard
    recognizes the encoded form directly and no presentation dial is involved.

  Three further classes improve for crawl data: paths containing a tab or
  newline, and URLs with surrounding whitespace, now parse (they previously
  returned `NA` and fell through to the raw-token fallback), and a literal
  space is percent-encoded rather than failing the parse. The cost is that
  `"whatwg"` preserves percent spellings, so `/a%7Eb` and `/a~b` are now two
  nodes, as they are to a crawler.

  **`rurl_params` is narrowed.** Because the profile now pins a standard
  selector, `rurl` rejects a conflicting override of the axes that selector
  governs — `case_handling` and `path_normalization`. Those two are node
  identity, so a caller who could move them could silently re-key the graph.
  Every other knob still overrides as before.

  Note `rurl`'s `profile = "seo"` is deliberately **not** used and is not a
  substitute: it bundles `protocol_handling = "https"`, `www_handling =
  "strip"`, `trailing_slash_handling = "strip"` and `index_page_handling =
  "strip"`, each of which is a redirect class pagerankr models as an edge.
  Folding those at canonicalization time turns the redirect into a self-loop.

* **`canonical_profile()` now follows "parse, do not fold".** pagerankr has
  redirects and canonical tags as first-class inputs, and those are the site's
  own statement about which URLs are the same page. Canonicalization therefore
  normalizes only what the *standard* makes the same resource and asserts
  nothing about site configuration. Three knobs move to match:

  * **`port_handling = "strip_default"`** (was the rurl default `"exclude"`). A
    non-default port is a different origin, so `http://host:8080/a` and
    `http://host/a` are now two nodes. `:80` on http and `:443` on https are
    redundant per spec and still fold.
  * **`host_encoding = "idna"`** (was `"keep"`). An IDN host and its punycode
    form are the same request on the wire, so no redirect or canonical can
    ever fold them -- the graph has to. `http://münchen.de/a` and
    `http://xn--mnchen-3ya.de/a` are now one node, keyed on the punycode form.
    Pass `rurl_params = list(host_encoding = "keep")` to restore the split.
  * **`query_handling = "filter"`** (was the rurl default `"drop"`). A contentful
    parameter is part of the resource: `?color=red` and `?color=blue` are two
    pages, and no redirect or canonical need exist between them. Tracking
    parameters are not, and are still dropped via the built-in rurl denylist
    (`utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`). **This is the largest behavior change here** --
    on a faceted site, node counts will rise. The six query sub-options
    (`params_keep`, `params_drop`, `params_case_sensitive`, `sort_params`,
    `empty_param_handling`, `decode_plus`) are now key-shaping and so are
    pinned explicitly too, all at the rurl defaults. `sort_params = FALSE`
    matches the rurl key contract, under which query order and duplicates
    are significant.

  The knobs that *would* fold a redirect class -- `www_handling`,
  `trailing_slash_handling`, `index_page_handling`, `protocol_handling` -- were
  already pinned to their non-folding values and are unchanged.

* **The declared `rurl` minimum is `>= 3.0.0`.** Two corrections landed in this
  cycle. `Imports:` previously required `rurl (>= 2.1.0)`, a version that was
  never released — `rurl` has no `2.1.0` tag, and its 2.x line begins at 2.2.0 —
  so the stated minimum named an artifact no user could install; that was
  corrected to `>= 2.2.0`, verified against `rurl` 2.2.0, 2.2.1 and 2.8.0 in
  isolated libraries with byte-identical canonical keys across all three. The
  floor then moved to `>= 3.0.0`, which is where the path-identity axis the
  profile now depends on lives. Note the 2.2.0 floor had also become impossible to test
  in practice: `rurl` inserted `scheme_policy` and `scheme_acceptance`
  *before* `url_standard` rather than appending them, so a positional
  `url_standard` argument silently binds to the wrong argument on eight functions across that
  range.

* **New vignette, `vignette("case-study")`, works the two-crawl fixture
  end to end.** A worked example that scores the same site before and after an
  internal-linking change on two lenses — the editorial (content-only) graph and
  the full graph — and shows that a change which moves the top page from rank #1
  to #38 on the first is invisible on the second (Pearson 0.9999). Every figure
  is computed from `inst/extdata/` at build time rather than quoted, so the
  vignette doubles as a regression check on the fixture. It also documents the
  three traps the comparison sets: scores do not sum to 1, so shares must be
  taken against `sum(pagerank)`; the two crawls have different node sets, so
  absolute PageRank is not comparable across them; and pages must be matched on
  the full URL, since external hosts share path strings with internal ones.
  `_pkgdown.yml` gains an `articles:` index grouping all six vignettes.
* **A two-crawl case-study fixture ships in `inst/extdata/`.** Two Screaming
  Frog exports of the same small site, taken either side of a deliberate
  internal-linking intervention, are now available as package data:
  `system.file("extdata", "reviews-microsite-before", package = "pagerankr")`
  and its `-after` counterpart, each holding `all_inlinks.csv` and
  `internal_all.csv`. Because the same site is measured twice, a change in
  PageRank is attributable to the intervention rather than to a difference
  between sites — which is what makes the pair usable for validating the
  placement and boilerplate models. Both exports are trimmed to the columns
  `sf_contract()` declares (18 and 24, down from Screaming Frog's 103), and
  `Link Path` is retained deliberately as the boilerplate detector's signal.
  The whole fixture is roughly 70 KB gzipped. The underlying site is
  pseudonymous: hosts, paths, anchors, alt text and page free-text are replaced
  rather than redacted, and `inst/extdata/README.md` documents exactly what is
  synthetic and what is preserved verbatim.
* **`pagerank()` surfaces a per-URL `wasted_mass` figure alongside `page_state`.**
  When `indexability_df` or `status_df` is supplied, the result now carries a
  `wasted_mass` column next to `page_state`: the authority each page collected
  and black-holed, i.e. its share of the shared waste sink's stationary mass.
  `page_state` labels the "collects but cannot pass" class per row; `wasted_mass`
  quantifies the amount, answering the other half of "a 404 page amassed *X*
  PageRank and it ends up in a black hole." Because a waste-class page routes its
  whole throughput through one edge to the absorbing sink, the value is
  `damping / (1 - damping)` times the page's own reported score — larger than,
  and deliberately distinct from, that score. Summed over the class it equals the
  evaporated mass in the transition audit (`mass$sink`); a `"live"` page routes
  nothing to the sink, so its `wasted_mass` is `0`. Like `page_state`, the column
  appears only when one of those inputs is present, mirroring how `prior_weight`
  appears only with `prior_df`.
* **Documented that `page_state` and `simulate_changes()`'s `node_status` are
  distinct axes, not two names for one thing.** `page_state` (live / noindex /
  robots_blocked / response_dead) is a page's health/index state; `node_status`
  (normal / new-target / removed-dead) is a node's role in a before/after
  comparison. They are kept separate on purpose: `new-target` has no health
  analog, and `removed-dead` is the single value bridging both axes (a node
  removed *because* its proposed health state is a forced 404). The two `@return`
  sections now cross-reference each other.

* **`simulate_changes()` gains a `remove_urls` verb for URL-level what-ifs.**
  Pass a character vector of URLs to model them returning 404: each keeps its
  inbound links (other pages still point at it) but their authority now flows
  into a dead page and *evaporates* to the shared waste sink, rather than
  redistributing across the site via teleport (dangle) or self-amplifying via a
  self-loop. The page's outbound links are dropped and the node stays in the
  output flagged `"removed-dead"` in `node_status`, so its residual absorbed
  mass is never misread as earned authority. This is the first consumer of the
  `status_df` / waste-sink dead-class mechanism: `remove_urls` forces a `404`
  into the proposed model only, leaving the baseline live. A URL appearing in
  both `remove_urls` and `redirect_urls_df` is an error (a page cannot be both a
  301 and a 404); the manifest gains `urls_removed`. Available on the Screaming
  Frog path via `simulate_changes_screaming_frog(remove_urls = ...)`, where the
  forced 404 composes on top of the bundle's real crawled status.

* **Page-state modeling — one faithful policy for pages that collect PageRank
  but cannot pass it (epic `PAGE-qzskzcfd`).** The three changes immediately
  below — `status_df`, the unified waste sink, and `prior_exclude_waste` —
  together replace three *accidental, inconsistent* behaviors for the noindex /
  robots-blocked / 4xx-5xx class with a single model: authority flows in, is
  booked, and stops. Before, the same class behaved three ways: a robots-blocked
  page self-looped and **self-amplified up to 8.3×** (scoring 0.8875 trapped vs
  0.1065 evaporating — holding 89% of a graph), 4xx/5xx pages were scored as
  ordinary live vertices, and uniform teleport let **1,000 fake dead URLs
  capture 95.2% of a site's PageRank** for merely existing. The class now routes
  to a shared waste sink, is excluded from the teleport vector, and is labeled
  per-row in `page_state` so absorbed mass is never read as earned authority.
  `robots_blocked_action` survives only as a presentation toggle
  (`"show"` / `"vanish"`); the self-looping `"trap"` is gone. **Any graph
  containing a class member changes score** — accepted pre-CRAN (experimental,
  single consumer). Reproducible experiment and full rationale:
  `notes/pagerank-behavior-field-notes.md` §11.
* **`pagerank()` gains `prior_exclude_waste` to keep the "collects but cannot
  pass" class out of the teleport vector.** With the default `TRUE`, the noindex,
  robots-blocked, and 4xx/5xx pages identified by `indexability_df` / `status_df`
  receive zero teleport mass: they still collect the authority their inlinks
  send, but are no longer paid the uniform teleport share for merely existing, so
  a page can no longer manufacture authority by pointing at many dead ends (Page
  & Brin 1998 criticize uniform teleport for "valuing pages simply because they
  exist"). This is a first-class replacement for the error-prone `prior_df` +
  `prior_alpha` workaround previously needed to zero teleport entries. Set
  `FALSE` to restore uniform teleport over every page, matching
  `igraph::page_rank()` for canonical comparisons. **Scores change whenever a
  non-empty class is present**; graphs with no such class — and any run without
  `indexability_df`/`status_df` — are numerically unchanged. The synthetic
  evaporation and leak sinks are excluded from teleport regardless of this flag,
  which is recorded in the transition audit as `config$prior_exclude_waste`. No
  effect under `reverse = TRUE`, where the class inputs are already rejected.
* **`pagerank()` gains a `status_df` input for HTTP response status.** Supply a
  `url` + `status_code` frame (column names configurable via `status_url_col`
  and `status_col`) and pages that returned a 4xx or 5xx code are identified as
  *response-dead* and counted in the transition audit (`config$has_status` and
  `dropped$n_status_dead`). 4xx and 5xx are treated identically — a crawl is a
  snapshot, and a transient `503` is indistinguishable from a permanent `404` at
  crawl time (the same reason a `302` is folded exactly like a `301`); `3xx`
  stays with `redirects_df`, and unparseable or sub-`400` codes are treated as
  live. `pagerank_screaming_frog()` now feeds status from the bundle's node
  table automatically instead of discarding it, and the `raw` preset leaves it
  off. Not supported with `reverse = TRUE`.
* **Unified waste-sink mechanism for the "collects PageRank but cannot pass it"
  class.** noindex, robots-blocked, and response-dead (4xx/5xx) pages now share
  one mechanism: each loses its outgoing edges and gains exactly one edge to a
  shared internal waste sink, so it absorbs the authority its inlinks send but
  passes none back into the graph. This removes the old robots-blocked
  self-loop, which was an absorbing rank sink that compounded inbound authority
  every iteration (a measured 8.3× inflation); **robots-blocked scores change
  accordingly.** A no-outlink 404 now gets the one sink edge that stops it from
  dangling and recycling its authority to every page via teleport.
    * `robots_blocked_action` values are renamed `c("trap", "vanish")` →
      `c("show", "vanish")`, default `"show"` (the self-loop "trap" is gone).
      Both values route the page's throughput to the sink; they differ only in
      whether the page is shown (`"show"`) or removed with its own mass booked
      as hidden (`"vanish"`).
    * noindex is decoupled from `nofollow_action`: a noindex page always routes
      to the sink, and `nofollow_action` now governs only real `rel=nofollow`
      edges. This changes noindex behavior only under `nofollow_action` `"drop"`
      / `"keep"`; the default `"evaporate"` is numerically unchanged.
    * When `indexability_df` or `status_df` is supplied, the result gains a
      `page_state` column tagging each visible page `"live"`, `"noindex"`,
      `"robots_blocked"`, or `"response_dead"`, so wasted mass is attributable
      per URL (robots-blocked > response-dead > noindex when a page carries more
      than one signal). It appears only with those inputs, mirroring how
      `prior_weight` appears only with `prior_df`.
* **`simulate_changes()` can now model URL-level what-ifs, not just edge-level
  ones.** The new `redirect_urls_df` argument (a two-column `from`/`to` frame)
  models retiring a page behind a redirect: it strips the live source's own
  outbound links before folding, so the target inherits the source's *inbound*
  authority only — never its outlinks — and the source drops out of the proposed
  set. A row for a source **overrides** any prior redirect for it (an earlier
  row, or the baseline crawl's real 3xx), so "repoint A→B into A→C" is a single
  override. Redirects pass authority through at 100% (the only per-hop loss is
  the global damping every edge already incurs). This replaces the removed
  `add_redirects_df`, which folded a live source *without* stripping its
  outedges and so modeled a content move rather than a retire.
* **New `on_unknown_target = c("warn", "error", "allow")`** controls what happens
  when a redirect or link target is not yet a node in the graph (it may be a
  legitimate new page); the default `"warn"` proceeds and models it as a new
  node carrying inbound authority.
* **The comparison output gains a `node_status` column** (`"normal"` or
  `"new-target"`) plus `proposed` (the full proposed `pagerank()` result, with
  its transition audit) and `manifest` (redirects applied/overridden, link
  add/remove counts, unknown targets) attributes.
* **New `simulate_changes_screaming_frog()`** applies the same what-if verbs to a
  `screaming_frog_bundle`, reusing the same bundle → `pagerank()` adapter as
  `pagerank_screaming_frog()` so placement, boilerplate, nofollow, and status
  are preserved automatically. Both entry points share one changeset engine.
* **Positional decay: `pagerank()` can now weight links by their reading order
  within the page.** Point the new `position_col` at a numeric per-source
  position index — `1` for the first link, `2` for the second — and each edge's
  weight is scaled by a reading-order decay. This is the orthogonal axis of the
  edge-weighting model: where placement and boilerplate describe *templatedness*
  and feed one graded axis combined by minimum, position describes *reading
  order* and composes by **multiplication**, so an above-the-fold boilerplate
  CTA (`0.5 × 1.0`) outranks a trailing organic link (`1.0 × 0.2`) with no
  special-casing. The decay reuses the existing `transform_weights()` shapes:
  `position_transform` is `"zipf"` (default, `1 / rank^position_alpha`) or
  `"rank_linear"`, applied within each source page's choice set, and
  `position_floor` (default `0.01`) clamps the result strictly above zero so
  compounding two axes can never reach an effective drop. Off unless
  `position_col` is supplied, and crawler-neutral: any crawler that can report a
  link's order can drive it. Recorded separately in the transition audit's
  `config$position`, so an edge's weight can be explained as region times
  reading order.
* **`screaming_frog_links()` now materializes that index at ingest.** The edge
  table gains a `position_index` column carrying each link's reading-order rank
  among its source page's content links — computed from document order for an
  **All Outlinks** export, and left `NA` for **All Inlinks**, whose row order is
  destination-alphabetical rather than document order. `pagerank_screaming_frog()`
  therefore drives the axis with `position_col = "position_index"`; it stays
  opt-in, so pass that argument to switch it on.
* **`pagerank_screaming_frog()` gains a `preset` argument, and `preset = "raw"`
  now actually produces the as-crawled graph.** Previously the wrapper fed
  `pagerank()` the bundle's declared canonical, redirect and indexability
  tables unconditionally, so a preset — which sets policy, never data — could
  not unset them, and `preset = "raw"` still folded canonicals/redirects and
  trapped robots-blocked pages. The `"raw"` view now switches all three
  declared tables off at the wrapper level. An explicit `apply_canonicals` or
  `apply_redirects` still overrides the `"raw"` default for that table; the
  import audit records `apply_indexability` alongside the existing two flags.
* **Boilerplate detection: `pagerank()` can now discount repetitive template
  links that sit in the main content.** Point the new `container_col` at a
  column identifying each link's source-side component and every edge is scored
  by *container-conditioned recurrence*: of the pages that component appears on,
  the share on which it points at this same target. A recycled call-to-action
  that always links the same place scores near `1` and is discounted; a
  related-posts module that links somewhere different on every page scores near
  `0` and keeps full weight — even though both recur identically. This catches
  what placement never can, because bylines, compliance links and recycled CTAs
  are structurally content. Tuned by `boilerplate_threshold` (default `0.5`, the
  ratio at which an edge is *classified*), `min_container_pages` (default `10`,
  an evidence floor) and `boilerplate_weight` (default `0.5`, the discount
  applied *once classified*). The last two constants are unrelated quantities
  that happen to share a value. Off unless `container_col` is supplied, and
  crawler-neutral: any crawler that can identify a link's component can drive it.
* **New `vignette("boilerplate")`** documents the detector: the
  container-conditioned metric and the direction of its ratio, the four
  arguments and why `boilerplate_threshold` and `boilerplate_weight` are
  unrelated despite sharing a default, how region weighting and recurrence
  compose as one graded axis rather than two multiplied ones, and which kinds of
  page the detector characteristically discounts.
* **New `sf_container_from_path()`** derives that component identity from a
  Screaming Frog `Link Path`, and `screaming_frog_links()` now carries a
  `container` column on both the observation and edge tables (counted in the
  link diagnostics as `container_rows`). The rule is: strip numeric `[n]`
  predicates, **keep** `[@class='…']`, then drop the trailing `<a>` step. This
  cuts the *opposite* way from `sf_region_from_path()`, which strips class
  predicates so a `div[@class='site-footer']` is not read as a `<footer>`; the
  two answer different questions ("which region is this" versus "is this the
  same component") and the inconsistency is deliberate.
  Rows with no `Link Path` get `NA` and stay unscored — unlike placement there
  is no `Link Position` fallback, because a region label cannot manufacture a
  component identity.
* `pagerank_screaming_frog()` does **not** enable the detector on its own. Pass
  `container_col = "container"` to opt in, exactly as a non-Screaming-Frog
  caller would; supplying the column is what switches detection on, so passing
  it automatically would change the default view.
* Placement and recurrence are two **detectors feeding one graded axis**, not
  two independent axes. A nav link is boilerplate by construction, so the two
  factors are *not* multiplied — that would discount the same link twice for the
  same fact. The strongest applicable discount wins: chrome `0.1`, repetitive
  in-content `0.5`, unique in-content `1`. The transition audit still records
  both factor sets separately in `config$placement` and `config$boilerplate`,
  since the resulting weight alone cannot say which detector produced it.
* The internal synthetic weight column is renamed `.__pr_placement_weight__` to
  **`.__pr_edge_weight__`**, since both weighting axes now write it. It surfaces
  in `attr(result, "transition_audit")$config$weight_col`.

* **Two new presets complete the set: `"reversed"` and `"content"`.**
  `pr_preset()` now registers `raw` · `declared` · `reversed` · `content`.
  `"reversed"` is the feeder view (`reverse = TRUE`); it is a no-op rather than
  an error under `topic_feeder_pagerank()`, which reverses the graph itself.
  `"content"` carries the placement recipe `c(content = 1, nav = 0.1,
  header = 0.1, footer = 0.1, aside = 0.1)`, so links found in site chrome are
  discounted to a tenth of an in-content link — downweighted, never dropped.
  All five regions are named on purpose: unnamed placements keep weight 1, so a
  partial recipe would leave footer and aside outweighing nav tenfold. Because
  a preset sets policy and never data, `"content"` still needs you to supply
  `placement_col`; `pagerank_screaming_frog()` supplies it from the bundle.
* **New `vignette("presets")`** documenting every preset's full expansion, the
  precedence rule, and how provenance is recorded in the transition audit.
* Asking for `placement_weights` or `accepted_placements` without
  `placement_col` now names the preset responsible when a preset is what set
  them, instead of reporting an argument the caller never typed.
* **Placement-aware scoring is now crawler-neutral.** `pagerank()` gains
  `placement_col`, `accepted_placements`, and `placement_weights`: point
  `placement_col` at a column holding the page region each link sits in and
  the region can filter or weight edges directly, e.g.
  `pagerank(edges, placement_col = "region", placement_weights = c(content = 1,
  nav = 0.1, header = 0.1, footer = 0.1, aside = 0.1))`. Placement is not a
  Screaming Frog concept — any crawler that reports link regions can drive it,
  with a per-crawler adapter (`sf_normalize_position()` for Screaming Frog)
  mapping vendor labels onto the shared vocabulary. All three arguments default
  to `NULL`, so nothing changes for callers that do not use them, and because
  they are `pagerank()` formals they compose with `preset` and are inherited by
  every wrapper that forwards `...`.
* **A Screaming Frog bundle's `placement` is now derived from the DOM path**
  rather than from `Link Position`, via a new exported `sf_region_from_path()`.
  `Link Position` loses the enclosing region whenever a `<nav>` is nested inside
  one: on a site whose footer is marked up as `footer > nav > a`, Screaming Frog
  reports every footer link as `Navigation` and emits no `Footer` bucket at all,
  so `footer` is not merely mislabeled but unreachable — a user wanting footer
  at 0.05 and nav at 0.2 had no way to express it. Other sites *do* emit
  `Footer`, so the vocabulary silently varied with the site's markup. The region
  is the outermost layout container on the path (`header`, `footer`, `aside`,
  else `content`), and `nav` applies only to a `<nav>` that is not inside one of
  those; `Link Position` remains the fallback for rows with no path, counted in
  the link diagnostics as `placement_from_position_rows`. Expect footer and
  header navigation to reclassify out of `nav` — this changes which edges
  `accepted_placements` selects, though not the usual recipe, which weights all
  three alike.
* The placement vocabulary term `"sidebar"` is renamed **`"aside"`**, matching
  both Screaming Frog's own label and the HTML element; `"sidebar"` is a layout
  word rather than a semantic one. `sf_normalize_position()` now returns
  `"aside"` where it previously returned `"sidebar"`, and `"sidebar"` is no
  longer accepted in `accepted_placements` / `placement_weights`.
* `pagerank_screaming_frog()` keeps its signature but is now a thin adapter:
  `accepted_placements` and `placement_weights` are forwarded to `pagerank()`,
  which owns the filtering and weighting. Two consequences for the
  `"screaming_frog_import"` attribute: `scoring$scored_edge_rows` is renamed
  `scoring$edge_rows_to_pagerank` (it counts rows after the wrapper-owned link
  origin filter, since placement filtering has moved down a layer), and
  `scoring$effective_weight_col` is dropped — the transition audit already
  carries it, alongside a new `config$placement` entry recording the placement
  column, filter, weights, and the number of rows the filter dropped.
* New `preset` argument on `pagerank()` and a new exported `pr_preset()`
  constructor: named argument bundles for recurring *views* of a link graph,
  so a view is a one-liner instead of a hand-assembled argument list. Two
  presets ship so far: `"raw"` (the graph exactly as crawled -- self loops and
  isolates kept, `rel=nofollow` ignored, no relabeling onto uncrawled fold
  targets) and `"declared"` (honor the signals the site declares -- nofollow
  evaporates, declared canonical and redirect targets are followed,
  robots-blocked pages keep the authority they collect, self loops and
  isolates dropped). `"declared"` is a **pure pin of the package defaults**:
  it changes nothing about how `pagerank()` behaves, it states the default
  view so a run can record which view was intended and stay pinned to that
  bundle if a default later moves. `preset`
  accepts a preset name, a `pr_preset()` result, or any hand-rolled named list
  of `pagerank()` arguments; bundles are plain named lists, so they are
  inspectable and spliceable via `do.call()`. Precedence is **explicit
  argument > preset > base default** -- a preset value is applied only to
  arguments the caller did not name -- and this holds through the wrappers
  that forward `...` to `pagerank()` (`trustrank()`,
  `topic_sensitive_pagerank()`, `topic_feeder_pagerank()`,
  `pagerank_screaming_frog()`), with the boundary that arguments a wrapper
  sets itself stay wrapper-owned. Presets are strictly opt-in; no default
  behavior changes.

* The `transition_audit` attached to a `pagerank()` result now records which
  preset produced it, in `config$preset`: the preset name for a registered
  preset (passed by name or as a `pr_preset()` result), `"custom"` for a
  hand-rolled bundle, and `NULL` when no preset was used. Two runs that expand
  to the same configuration are no longer indistinguishable in the audit --
  which *named view* was asked for is itself a provenance fact, and it is the
  only durable record of intent for a pin like `"declared"`. `print()` shows a
  `Preset:` line only when a preset was used, so default output is unchanged.

* **Breaking:** the six dot-prefixed Screaming Frog helpers are renamed without
  their leading dot and are now documented public API: `.sf_contract()`,
  `.sf_read_input()`, `.sf_parse_follow()`, `.sf_rel_nofollow()`,
  `.sf_normalize_position()`, and `.sf_graph_eligible()` become
  `sf_contract()`, `sf_read_input()`, `sf_parse_follow()`,
  `sf_rel_nofollow()`, `sf_normalize_position()`, and `sf_graph_eligible()`.
  A leading dot conventionally signals "internal", but these were already
  exported -- and exported with `@noRd`, so they had no help pages at all.
  They are intended for downstream Screaming Frog workflows, so they now carry
  full documentation (parameters, return values, examples) and are grouped as
  `@family Screaming Frog toolkit` with their own pkgdown reference section.
  Behavior and signatures are unchanged. The many genuinely internal `.sf_*`
  helpers keep their leading dot and remain unexported.

* **Breaking:** `resolve_urls()` is renamed to `resolve_redirect_urls()`. The
  function originally resolved redirects *and* canonicals together; once that
  was split apart (mixing the two is lossy) the old name no longer described
  what it does. The new name states the operation and restores symmetry with
  the rest of the `resolve_*` family, which pairs an edge-list form with a
  URL-vector form: `resolve_redirects()` / `resolve_redirect_urls()` alongside
  the existing `resolve_canonicals()` / `resolve_canonical_urls()`. Behavior,
  arguments, and return value are unchanged.

* The `resolve_*` naming convention is now documented and enforced by grouping:
  functions taking a character vector of URLs are tagged
  `@family URL-vector resolvers` (`resolve_redirect_urls()`,
  `resolve_canonical_urls()`, `resolve_folded_urls()`) and functions taking an
  `edge_list_df` are tagged `@family edge-list resolvers`
  (`resolve_redirects()`, `resolve_canonicals()`, `resolve_links()`), so each
  help page cross-links its input-type peers.

* The weight/teleport transform vocabulary now uses one canonical option order
  (`"none"`, `"log"`, `"percentile"`, `"minmax"`, `"zipf"`, `"rank_linear"`) at
  every call site -- `transform_weights()`, `transform_edge_weights()`,
  `pagerank(prior_transform=)`, `align_prior_to_vertices()`, and
  `ga4_entrance_teleport()`. No defaults change: `transform_edge_weights()`
  still defaults to `"zipf"` (now declared explicitly rather than by option
  order) and every other site still defaults to `"none"`.

* Documented that `canonical_profile()` deliberately leaves `rurl`'s
  component-dropping knobs unpinned (`query_handling`, `port_handling`, and the
  `url_standard` selector added in `rurl` 2.2.0) -- they have no effect on the
  scheme+host+path node key at their defaults. Added a behavioral guard in
  `test-canonicalization.R` asserting a canonical key drops the port, query, and
  fragment, so a future `rurl` default flip on an unpinned knob is caught here
  rather than silently changing node identity. No node keys change; verified
  against `rurl` 2.2.0.

* `canonical_profile()` now pins `path_normalization = "dot_segments"` and
  `path_encoding = "decode"` (previously `"none"` / `"keep"`). `rurl` 2.1.0
  silently redefined those two default values to keep the path verbatim, which
  changed node keys for any URL with dot-segments (`/a/../b`) or percent-encoding
  (`/%41`, `%20`) and desynced the pagerankr <-> semantic node join. Pinning the
  explicit values restores the original committed key (path percent-decoded,
  dot-segments removed) and keeps node identities stable across the `rurl`
  upgrade. The `semantic` sibling pins the identical profile (changed together).

* `clean_url_columns()` now preserves tokens that `rurl` cannot parse as a URL
  (e.g. a dotless bare label such as `"A"`) as their raw value instead of
  turning them into NA. Newer `rurl` (>= 2.1.0) normalizes such dotless tokens
  to NA; combined with the `rurl` floor bump in the follow-up,
  this had silently collapsed non-URL node identities to NA — they were then
  dropped by `get_unique_edges()`, so [pagerank()] returned an empty result for
  any graph built from bare labels. Unparseable-but-present tokens are now kept
  as opaque nodes (only genuinely missing NA inputs stay NA), mirroring
  `.apply_fold_map()`'s leave-unmapped-values-untouched contract.

* `filter_links_by_domain()`'s encoding-independent registrable-domain matching
  now reads `rurl`'s new `domain_ascii` column (`rurl` >= 2.1.0) instead of a
  separate IDNA-forced parse. `.build_url_maps()` parses each unique URL once
  (host + `domain_ascii`) rather than twice, and the `.domain_profile()`
  forced-idna helper is gone. Behavior is unchanged — `münchen.de` and
  `xn--mnchen-3ya.de` still fold to one key under every `host_encoding`.

* `pagerank_screaming_frog()` gains `apply_canonicals` and `apply_redirects`
  toggles (both `TRUE` by default, preserving current behavior). Setting either
  to `FALSE` skips folding the bundle's canonical / redirect signals into
  [pagerank()] (passes `canonicals_df` / `redirects_df` as `NULL`), giving a
  supported as-crawled run that keeps the crawled node identities — the escape
  hatch for crawls whose canonicals point off the crawled domain (mirror /
  staging hosts) and would otherwise relabel crawled pages onto uncrawled
  targets. The reserved-argument guard still blocks the raw `canonicals_df` /
  `redirects_df` pagerank arguments. `screaming_frog_bundle()` now reports an
  off-domain canonical count (`counts$canonicals_off_domain`, surfaced in
  `summary()`/`print()`), reusing the existing absent-target classification, and
  the wrapper exposes it on the `screaming_frog_import` audit so the
  mirror-staging scenario is visible at import and scoring time.

* `pagerank()` now detects **fold-target collisions**: when a canonical/redirect
  relabels a crawled page's node onto an *uncrawled* URL that is ALSO
  independently referenced as a genuine link endpoint, the two silently merge
  into one vertex and the crawled page absorbs the inbound link equity of that
  uncrawled URL.
  `pagerank()` emits a `warning()` naming the merged URL(s) and records them in
  the `fold` section of the `transition_audit` object under a new `collisions`
  field (a data frame of `target` / `n_independent_refs` / `source`, or `NULL`
  when none). The crawl's known-URL set (`indexability_df`) is used to tell an
  uncrawled fold target from a genuinely crawled leaf page, so the diagnostic is
  only computed when an `indexability_df` is supplied.

* `pagerank()` now warns when a `keep_domains` / `exclude_domains` /
  `keep_hosts` / `exclude_hosts` value matched the crawled input but no node
  after folding — i.e. an out-of-scope canonical/redirect rewrote the crawled
  domain/host away before filtering (which runs after folding). The warning
  names the folded-away value(s) and points at the fold as the cause. The
  fold-then-filter ordering is now documented explicitly in the `pagerank()`
  and `filter_links_by_domain()` docs; to scope the crawled input, filter with
  `filter_links_by_domain()` before calling `pagerank()`.

* `out_of_scope_fold` gains a third policy, `"leak"`: a crawled page whose
  canonical/redirect folds out of scope is treated like an external redirect —
  its inbound equity is routed onto a dedicated leak sink and evaporates out of
  the measured graph (its outbound edges are dropped), so it does not rank and
  its equity is not credited to any surviving page. The evaporated equity is
  reported as a new `leaked` term in the `transition_audit` `mass` accounting,
  which now decomposes as `reported + sink + leaked + hidden = total` (`= 1`);
  `leaked` is `0` for `"relabel"`/`"keep"` runs so their totals are unchanged.
  The `fold` audit section reports `policy == "leak"`.

* `pagerank()` gains an `out_of_scope_fold` argument (`"relabel"` default, or
  `"keep"`) governing composed fold-map entries whose target is not itself a
  crawled node. `"relabel"` preserves current behavior (fold crawled sources
  onto uncrawled canonical/redirect targets); `"keep"` drops those out-of-scope
  entries before folding so crawled pages retain their as-crawled identity
  rather than being relabeled to phantom vertices (the same filtered map folds
  the TIPR prior). Regardless of policy, the count and list of out-of-scope
  folds (source, target, signal) are recorded in a new `fold` section of the
  `transition_audit` object.

* Code-quality pass: `anyNA()` replaces `any(is.na())`, `!all(x)` replaces
  `any(!x)`, nested `ifelse()` replaced with vectorized assignment,
  `expect_gt()`/`expect_lt()`/`expect_length()`/`expect_null()` adopted where
  applicable, and redundant `c()` wrappers around single-string aliases removed.

* `pagerank()` and `compute_pagerank()` gain convergence controls and reporting.
  The new `algo` argument selects the `igraph::page_rank()` back-end
  (`"prpack"`, the fast exact default, or `"arpack"`, the iterative solver), and
  the friendly `eps` / `niter` aliases re-introduce the L1 tolerance and maximum
  iteration count that modern `igraph` dropped, mapping onto the ARPACK
  `options$tol` / `options$maxiter`; supplying either transparently switches to
  ARPACK. Every non-empty result now carries a `"convergence"` attribute (a
  `pagerank_convergence` object) reporting the solver, iteration count (when the
  solver exposes it), and a solver-independent post-hoc L1 residual
  `||Gx - x||_1` of the returned vector — a genuine quality check comparable
  across both back-ends. Docs cover the damping/iteration-count rule of thumb
  `log10(eps) / log10(damping)`.
* New `topic_feeder_pagerank()` answers the inverse of
  `topic_sensitive_pagerank()`: not "which page is most authoritative *for* this
  cluster" but "which pages *feed / power* this cluster" — the internal hubs
  whose outlinks point into the target pages. It seeds the teleport prior on the
  cluster and runs `pagerank()` on the transposed graph (`reverse = TRUE`), so
  mass walks backward along links and accumulates on the feeders, attenuating
  with link distance. This is the reverse-graph sibling of Topic-Sensitive
  PageRank and the cluster-biased counterpart to the global inverse PageRank
  (`pagerank(reverse = TRUE)`); the feeders are the high-`pagerank` rows with
  `prior_weight == 0` (cluster pages carry teleport mass directly). Pure
  orchestration over the existing TIPR personalization path on the reversed
  graph — no new solver. New `topic_feeder_pagerank` vignette walks through the
  AI-Agent-cluster use case and contrasts it with the forward authority view and
  with HITS hubs.
* New `salsa()` and `compute_salsa()` add Lempel & Moran's (2001) SALSA hub and
  authority scores: a stochastic variant of HITS that runs the
  mutual-reinforcement step as PageRank-style random walks on the bipartite
  hub/authority graph, so the scores are stationary distributions rather than
  dominant eigenvectors. Computed over the same cleaned,
  redirect/canonical-folded, domain-filtered, deduplicated link graph as
  `pagerank()`, so hub, authority, and PageRank share node identities. Uses the
  degree-based closed form (Proposition 6) — no eigenvector iteration — with the
  required weakly-connected-component mass-weighting correction so
  cross-component scores stay comparable on crawls with orphan clusters. Each
  side sums to 1; coverage differs from PageRank by design (`hub` is `NA` for
  pure sinks, `authority` is `NA` for pure sources). v1 is unweighted; a
  weighted extension is deferred. Documented as a site-graph adaptation of the
  original focused-subgraph algorithm.
* New `trustrank()` and the shared `seed_prior()` builder add TrustRank-style
  seed-biased PageRank (Gyöngyi, Garcia-Molina & Pedersen, 2004): personalized
  PageRank whose teleport vector is concentrated on a set of trusted seed pages,
  so trust flows outward from the seeds and attenuates with distance (the
  damping factor *is* the attenuation). `seed_prior()` builds a `prior_df` from
  a seed set (character vector or weighted `data.frame`; equal weights reproduce
  the original uniform seed distribution) and is orientation-agnostic — the same
  builder feeds `topic_feeder_pagerank()` on the reversed graph. `trustrank()`
  is the one-call wrapper that builds the seed prior and runs `pagerank()` with
  it. Pure
  orchestration over the existing TIPR personalization path — no new solver;
  seed selection is the caller's (it is seed-biased PageRank, not a spam
  classifier). New `trustrank` vignette walks through a worked example.
* New `topic_sensitive_pagerank()` computes per-topic PageRank by running the
  existing `pagerank()` engine once per topic with a teleport prior biased
  toward each topic's seed cluster, then blends the per-topic scores into a
  single ranking. This is Haveliwala's (2002) Topic-Sensitive PageRank adapted
  to a single site: each "topic" is a content cluster (e.g. the *pricing* or
  *AI-Agent* area) given as a character vector of seed URLs or a weighted
  `data.frame`. Returns one score column per topic plus a weight-normalized
  `blended` column, with the per-topic `transition_audit` objects attached.
  Pure orchestration over the TIPR personalization path — no new solver, and
  topic membership is supplied by the caller, not inferred.
* New `smooth_transitions()` shrinks sparse empirical page-transition shares
  (e.g. from `ga4_page_transitions()`) toward the crawl-graph link structure,
  so no valid crawled link is ever assigned exactly zero probability. Uses a
  per-source Dirichlet/pseudocount shrinkage weight `lambda_i = n_i / (n_i + k)`
  that increases with the source page's sample size, with `min_support`
  fallback to the prior, optional weighted priors, and an `origin` diagnostic
  (`both` / `empirical_only` / `structural_only`). Time decay and
  device/template/channel segmentation are handled upstream by shaping the
  count input.
* New `hits()` and `compute_hits()` add Kleinberg's HITS hub and authority
  scores, computed with `igraph::hits_scores()` over the same cleaned,
  redirect/canonical-folded, domain-filtered, deduplicated link graph as
  `pagerank()`, so hub, authority, and PageRank share node identities. Docs
  cover the matrix formulation (authority = dominant eigenvector of `A^T A`,
  hub = dominant eigenvector of `A A^T`) and the whole-graph caveat: unlike
  Kleinberg's query-focused base set, these are site-wide structural
  centralities.
* `pagerank()` now has an explicit `duplicate_edge_policy` for repeated
  `from -> to` rows after URL folding and filtering. The default `"collapse"`
  preserves the standard binary/destination-level PageRank convention and
  previous results; opt-in `"aggregate"` sums duplicate numeric weights with
  `aggregate_edges()` semantics; opt-in `"count_instances"` models a
  link-slot surfer where repeated links increase transition probability and
  records instance-count details in the transition audit.
* Recorded representative Screaming Frog crawl acceptance results and added
  package-level operational documentation for required exports, default graph
  policy, optional origin/placement policies, and contract pinning.
* New `pagerank_screaming_frog()` scores a `screaming_frog_bundle()` through
  the existing `pagerank()` pipeline, feeding only graph-eligible hyperlink
  edges while attaching Screaming Frog import diagnostics beside the transition
  audit. Placement/origin filtering and placement-derived weighting are
  explicit opt-ins.
* New `screaming_frog_bundle()` composes Internal: All and All Inlinks/Outlinks
  adapters into the stable crawl handoff object with raw observations, graph
  edges, node signals, cross-table reconciliation diagnostics, provenance, and
  concise print/summary methods.
* New canonical and composed URL-resolution helpers:
  `resolve_canonicals()`, `resolve_canonical_urls()`, and
  `resolve_folded_urls()` expose the existing fold-map engine for rel=canonical
  and redirect+canonical URL folding without duplicating resolver logic.
* Documented the indexed-corpus assumption used by `pagerank()`: noindex
  pages may receive authority but their outlinks are treated as nofollow for
  propagation within the indexed graph. The docs now distinguish
  slot-consuming `"evaporate"`, slot-removing `"drop"`, and normally followed
  `"keep"` without attributing this package model to Google.
* New `screaming_frog_links()` imports **All Inlinks** and **All Outlinks**
  with identical Source-to-Destination orientation, preserving raw duplicate
  observations while deriving explicit Hyperlink-only graph edges with
  nofollow, placement, origin, endpoint, and exclusion diagnostics.
* New `screaming_frog_internal()` imports UTF-8/BOM **Internal: All** exports
  with alias-insensitive schema detection and selective file reads. It returns
  deterministic node, redirect, canonical, and indexability tables while
  preserving raw URLs and reporting missing, duplicate, invalid, and ignored
  input facts.
* `pagerank()` now attaches a `transition_audit` provenance object to its result
  as `attr(result, "transition_audit")` (backward-compatible): row/edge counts,
  behavioral-weight coverage, normalization total, dropped data (NA / dedup /
  self-loop rows, unmatched prior URLs), robots-blocked count, and the model
  configuration used. Has a `print` method.
* The `transition_audit` object's `mass` field now decomposes the page-mass
  deficit precisely into `reported` (visible page mass), `sink` (evaporated
  nofollow-sink mass), `hidden` (robots-blocked mass), and `total` (= 1 by
  construction) — replacing undifferentiated "leakage" language with precise
  evaporated/hidden accounting.
* New `aggregate_edges()`: loss-aware post-fold edge aggregation with explicit
  per-column semantics (sum counts, boolean conflict policy `any`/`all`/
  `majority`/`error`, `preserve_cols` list-columns for placement features).
* New `transform_edge_weights()`: per-source grouped weight transforms reusing
  `transform_weights()` methods, emitting a per-source `transition_probability`
  that sums to 1 within each `by` group.
* New `ga4_page_transitions()`: consecutive-page-view transition counts from a
  GA4 BigQuery export with a deterministic session/event ordering contract
  (timestamp + batch tie-breaks). A transition signal, not a link-click signal.
* New `ga4_entrance_teleport()`: entrance/landing-page counts as a teleport
  (reset) vector reusing the `prior_df` / `align_prior_to_vertices()` machinery;
  documented as a proxy, distinct from the backlink-authority prior.

* Initial CI and lint baseline.

## Internal

* The agent instructions no longer import `FP_AGENTS.md`, the file the `fp`
  tracker generates, which is deleted. `AGENTS.md` points at the house
  `agent-workflow` and `fp` skills for the git workflow (`SEOR-ipwcbcov`).

* **The two dependency audits run on a dedicated schedule, and the OSS Index
  one now runs at all.** `osv-audit` fired on every pipeline schedule, on
  `main` pushes that touched `DESCRIPTION` or its test, and as a manual job on
  every pipeline; it now fires only on a schedule that sets
  `SCHEDULE_KIND=dependency-audit`, or by hand. A new `security-audit` job runs
  `test-security.R` under the same rules with `OSSINDEX_AUDIT_REQUIRED=true`,
  so missing OSS Index credentials fail the job instead of letting it pass
  having audited nothing (`SEOR-fftbjnpl`).

* **`SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml` describes the project as it is hosted now.** It
  still cited GitHub issues, releases, Actions workflows that no longer exist,
  Codecov, a `github.io` site and GitHub private vulnerability reporting. It now
  cites the GitLab repository and tracker, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the `gitlab.io`
  site and the channels `SECURITY.md` names (`SEOR-wmtfrsjq`).

* **`.bestpractices.json` now names GitLab and describes today's CI, and
  `scripts/bestpractices-url.py`, copied from the `seor` repository, pushes
  it.** The OpenSSF self-assessment still cited GitHub Issues, GitHub private
  vulnerability reporting, the deleted `.github/workflows/` files, Codecov and
  the `github.io` site. Every justification now points at the GitLab repository,
  work items, pipelines and the pkgdown site `DESCRIPTION` declares, and names
  GitHub only as the read-only mirror. Four answers moved to what the repository
  actually does: `static_analysis_common_vulnerabilities`, `dynamic_analysis`
  and `tests_documented_added` are Unmet, and `dynamic_analysis_fixed` is N/A.
  The OpenSSF Best Practices site does not import the file from a GitLab
  repository, so the script turns it into edit links the owner opens and saves,
  and `--check` compares the live entry with the file. A pre-push hook runs its
  offline self-test when the script changes (`SEOR-grrcptww`).

* **The OSS Index audit judges each advisory by disposition, not by "the scan
  is empty".** `tests/testthat/test-security.R` now reads an allow-list in the
  new `tests/testthat/helper-security.R`: a reported advisory not on the list
  fails, a listed advisory no longer reported fails, and a row past its review
  date or version warns. The list is empty because the 24-package hard
  dependency closure reports zero advisories. A validator checks every row
  against fixtures, an audit that resolves no packages fails, and under
  `OSSINDEX_AUDIT_REQUIRED=true` a missing `oysteR` or missing credentials is a
  failure rather than a skip, so a future credentialed audit job cannot go
  green having audited nothing (`SEOR-fftbjnpl`).

* **The pre-push verify gate fails when a checker is missing, instead of
  skipping the check and exiting 0.** Four checks -- citation, the
  `BugReports:` split, spelling and `R CMD check` -- were guarded by "is the
  tool installed?" tests that printed a warning line on a miss and let the gate
  pass. On a feature
  branch this hook is the only gate that runs anywhere, so its most degraded
  form still reported success. A missing checker is now a failed gate. The
  opt-in bypasses (`SKIP_VERIFY`, `SKIP_RCMDCHECK`, `SKIP_SPELLING`) are
  unchanged and report as `SKIP (opt-in)` rather than as passes. The gate also
  runs every check before reporting and ends with a verdict list naming each
  one, so "the gate passed" is a claim about a named set (`SEOR-dzrisdmi`).

* **`scripts/check-bugreports.py` now runs in CI.** It had zero references in
  `.gitlab-ci.yml`, so the newest gate in the fleet ran on a correctly
  provisioned laptop and nowhere else. It joins the existing `citation-version`
  job, which already runs on a python image (`SEOR-dzrisdmi`).

* `scripts/gates.R` takes optional gate names and a `--no-summary` flag, so the
  pre-push hook runs the same `news-version` and `codemeta` implementations CI
  runs instead of a second copy of the rules in bash (`SEOR-dzrisdmi`).

* `DESCRIPTION`'s `URL:` now lists the package's r-universe page. r-universe
  records this repository's upstream owner as `gitlab-bart-turczynski` because
  it is hosted on GitLab, which does not match the `bart-turczynski` universe,
  so the package was built and served but hidden from r-universe search. The
  URL claims it (`SEOR-zfamoutf`).

* The OSS Index dependency audit in `tests/testthat/test-security.R` scopes to
  hard dependencies (`Depends` + `Imports`) instead of the `Suggests` tree.
  `oysteR::expect_secure()` audits `Suggests` too, which pulled in oysteR's own
  recursive dependencies -- `curl` among them -- and failed the pre-push gate on
  a vulnerability in the auditor rather than in anything pagerankr ships. Scoped
  to hard dependencies the audit covers 23 packages and is clean; the old scope
  covered 126 (`PAGE-aqnbdkov`).

* CI adds CRAN behind the image's Posit Package Manager repo. p3m lags CRAN by
  up to a day for a new release -- on the day rurl 3.0.1 was published, the
  2026-09-09 p3m snapshot *and* p3m `latest` both still served 1.2.0 -- so
  `Imports: rurl (>= 3.0.1)` was unresolvable at any pin and every
  dependency-resolving job failed. p3m stays first, so packages still arrive as
  prebuilt binaries; CRAN only supplies what p3m has not synced yet.

* The `rurl-floor` CI job resolves the floor from CRAN (current *or* archived)
  instead of reading the source forge out of `Remotes:` and installing a git
  tag. It now runs on every merge request rather than manually, because it can
  pass. Its GitHub-hosted twin, which had no live runner and hard-failed on the
  removed `Remotes:` field, was deleted; the GitLab job supersedes it.

* The pre-push hook's non-gating rurl skew notice compares the installed `rurl`
  against CRAN rather than against the `Remotes:` target. The skew it warns
  about is not hypothetical: a local 3.0.0 build sat in front of CRAN 3.0.1
  here and hid a new `get_clean_url` argument from the suite.
