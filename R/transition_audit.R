#' @title Transition-construction audit / provenance object
#' @name transition_audit
#' @description Builds a stable, documented audit / provenance record describing
#'   what happened to the edges and weights as [pagerank()] turned a raw edge
#'   list into the transition graph it scored. It is the backbone of
#'   reproducibility and of downstream diagnostics: it carries the row/edge
#'   counts, behavioral-weight coverage, normalization totals, the data that was
#'   dropped along the way (rows lost to NA / deduplication / self-loop removal,
#'   and authority-prior URLs that never folded onto a vertex), and the relevant
#'   [pagerank()] configuration. It also records the duplicate-edge policy used
#'   to build transitions, so callers can distinguish the default
#'   destination-level surfer from opt-in aggregate / link-slot models.
#'
#' @details
#' ## Structure and contract
#'
#' The object is an S3 list with class `"transition_audit"` (a list was chosen
#' over a bare list so that it prints a human-readable summary while remaining a
#' plain, inspectable `list` for programmatic access — `audit$counts$n_edges`
#' works as expected, mirroring the existing [audit_redirects()] /
#' [audit_canonicals()] objects in this package). The documented top-level
#' fields are **stable**; callers may rely on them being present.
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{counts}{A list of integer counts: `n_input_rows` (rows in the raw
#'     `edge_list_df`), `n_edges` (directed edges remaining after URL folding,
#'     deduplication and self-loop handling — i.e. the edges actually scored),
#'     and `n_vertices` (vertices in the returned result).}
#'   \item{coverage}{A list describing behavioral-weight coverage: `weighted`
#'     (logical, whether a `weight_col` was in effect), `weight_col` (its name
#'     or `NULL`), `n_edges_weighted` (edges carrying a finite, positive
#'     weight), and `coverage` (the fraction `n_edges_weighted / n_edges`, or
#'     `NA_real_` when there are no edges / no weighting).}
#'   \item{normalization}{A list of normalization totals: `pagerank_total` (sum
#'     of the returned PageRank scores; `< 1` when mass evaporated via nofollow,
#'     vanished robots-blocked pages, etc.).}
#'   \item{dropped}{A list accounting for data removed during construction:
#'     `n_rows_na` (input rows dropped because `from`/`to` was `NA`),
#'     `n_rows_duplicate` (rows collapsed by edge deduplication),
#'     `n_self_loops` (self-loop edges dropped when `self_loops = "drop"`),
#'     `n_rows_collapsed` (total input rows that did not survive as distinct
#'     scored edges = `n_input_rows - n_edges`), `n_prior_unmatched` (authority
#'     prior URLs that did not fold onto any vertex; `NA_integer_` when no
#'     `prior_df` was supplied), `n_robots_blocked` (URLs treated as
#'     robots.txt-blocked), and `n_status_dead` (in-graph URLs whose HTTP
#'     status code marked them response-dead; `0` when no `status_df` was
#'     supplied).}
#'   \item{duplicates}{A list describing duplicate-edge handling:
#'     `policy` (the `duplicate_edge_policy` passed to [pagerank()]),
#'     `n_duplicate_rows` (post-fold duplicate input rows), `instance_count_col`
#'     (the internal audit column used by `"count_instances"`, or `NULL`), and
#'     `n_duplicate_instances` (the number of duplicate link instances folded
#'     into transition weights), and `duplicate_edges` (a compact data frame of
#'     counted edges with more than one link instance, or `NULL`).}
#'   \item{config}{A list of the [pagerank()] arguments that materially shape
#'     the transition graph. `preset` records the *provenance* of the rest:
#'     the name of the [pr_preset()] bundle the caller asked for (e.g.
#'     `"declared"`), `"custom"` for a hand-rolled bundle, or `NULL` when no
#'     preset was used — so a run made as a named view stays distinguishable
#'     from the same arguments typed out by hand. `placement` records
#'     placement-aware weighting when it was used (`placement_col`,
#'     `accepted_placements`, `placement_weights`, and `n_rows_dropped`, the
#'     number of edge rows the placement filter removed), or `NULL` when it was
#'     not — so a downweighted edge can be explained by the region it sits in
#'     rather than only by the opaque weight column it produced. `boilerplate`
#'     records the recurrence detector the same way when it was used
#'     (`container_col`, `boilerplate_threshold`, `min_container_pages`,
#'     `boilerplate_weight`, and the counts `n_containers`, `n_edges_scored`,
#'     `n_edges_judged` and `n_edges_discounted`), or `NULL` when it was not.
#'     Placement and recurrence are two detectors feeding one graded axis, and
#'     the strongest applicable discount wins, so both are recorded
#'     **separately**: the resulting weight alone cannot say which detector
#'     produced it. `position` records the orthogonal reading-order axis the
#'     same way when it was used (`position_col`, `position_transform`,
#'     `position_alpha`, `position_floor`, and the counts `n_edges_scored`,
#'     `n_sources_scored`, and `min_position_weight`), or `NULL` when it was
#'     not -- it *multiplies* into the weight rather than competing for the
#'     minimum, so it too is recorded on its own so an edge weighing `0.02` can
#'     be explained as region times reading order. The other fields are the
#'     resolved configuration itself: `self_loops`, `drop_isolates_flag`,
#'     `reverse`,
#'     `weight_col`, `nofollow_col`, `nofollow_action`, `robots_blocked_action`,
#'     `prior_alpha`, `prior_transform`, `prior_inject_unmatched`, and the
#'     logical flags `has_redirects` / `has_canonicals` (whether that signal
#'     *materially* folded an edge — an effective no-op such as a self-canonical
#'     reads `FALSE`), `has_indexability`, and `has_prior`.}
#'   \item{mass}{A list decomposing the internal stationary vector (which
#'     always sums to 1) into its accounted-for components: `reported` (the
#'     mass on returned, visible pages — equals the summed result scores),
#'     `sink` (the **evaporated mass**: authority routed to the shared waste
#'     sink — what the whole waste class (noindex / robots-blocked / 4xx-5xx)
#'     and every real nofollowed link under `nofollow_action = "evaporate"`
#'     passed on but could not deliver),
#'     `leaked` (the **leaked mass**: authority sent to the synthetic leak sink
#'     under `out_of_scope_fold = "leak"`, i.e. equity that flowed into
#'     out-of-scope-folded sources and left the measured graph — `0` when no
#'     leak occurred), `hidden` (the **hidden mass**: the own stationary mass of
#'     robots-blocked nodes removed under `robots_blocked_action = "vanish"`;
#'     their pass-through still routes to the waste sink and is counted in
#'     `sink`), and `total` (their sum, which
#'     reconciles to 1 by construction). These are the precise components of
#'     the deficit between the reported scores and 1 — it is evaporated, leaked
#'     and hidden mass, not undifferentiated "leakage". Each is `NULL` when the
#'     stationary vector is undefined (e.g. an empty graph).}
#'   \item{fold}{A list recording how **out-of-scope folds** were handled — a
#'     composed fold-map entry whose *target* (the representative a crawled
#'     source folds onto) is not itself a crawled node, which silently invents
#'     a phantom vertex. `policy` (the `out_of_scope_fold` argument,
#'     `"relabel"`, `"keep"` or `"leak"`), `n_out_of_scope` (count of such
#'     entries), `applied` (logical: `TRUE` when they were acted upon —
#'     relabeled / folded through under `"relabel"`, or routed to the leak sink
#'     under `"leak"` — and `FALSE` when skipped / kept as crawled under
#'     `"keep"`; combine with `policy` to distinguish relabel from leak), and
#'     `out_of_scope` (a data frame of the offending `source` / `target` /
#'     `signal` rows, or `NULL` when there were none), and `collisions` (a data
#'     frame of **fold-target collisions** — uncrawled URLs that a fold
#'     relabeled a crawled source onto while they were ALSO independently
#'     linked, so the two silently merge into one vertex and the crawled page
#'     absorbs the inbound link equity of that uncrawled URL; columns `target`,
#'     `n_independent_refs` and the folded `source`(s) — or `NULL` when none). A
#'     collision triggers a `warning()` naming the merged URL(s). This
#'     diagnostic requires crawl-URL knowledge to distinguish an uncrawled fold
#'     target from a genuinely crawled leaf page, so it is only computed when an
#'     `indexability_df` is supplied to [pagerank()]; without it, `collisions`
#'     is `NULL`. Recorded regardless of `out_of_scope_fold` policy.}
#' }

#' [pagerank()]; the object is normally obtained via
