#' @title Master PageRank Calculation Wrapper
#' @description Orchestrates the complete PageRank calculation workflow,
#' including URL cleaning, redirect resolution, edge deduplication,
#' indexability handling, nofollow handling, isolate handling, and
#' PageRank computation.
#' @name pagerank
#'
#' @param edge_list_df A data frame representing the edge list, typically with
#'   columns like "from" and "to". Edges are expected to be page-to-page
#'   hyperlinks: `pagerank()` is graph-agnostic and treats every endpoint as a
#'   node, so resource links (images, CSS, JS, and other non-HTML references)
#'   must be filtered upstream or they collect authority as ordinary vertices.
#'   `pagerank_screaming_frog()` does this at the crawl boundary via
#'   [sf_graph_eligible()] (`Hyperlink` only); a hand-built or non-SF edge list
#'   should apply the same hyperlink-only filter before scoring.
#' @param redirects_df An optional data frame for redirect rules, typically
#'   with "from" and "to" columns. Defaults to NULL.
#' @param clean_edge_urls Logical, whether to clean URLs in the edge list.
#'   Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param clean_redirect_urls Logical, whether to clean URLs in the redirect
#'   list. Defaults to TRUE. Only effective if `redirects_df` is provided.
#' @param rurl_params A list of parameters to pass to `rurl::clean_url`.
#'   Defaults to an empty list. `protocol_handling` defaults to `"keep"` and
#'   `case_handling` to `"lower_host"` for cross-project canonicalization
#'   consistency. If you set `host_encoding` (`"idna"` or `"unicode"`) to fold
#'   internationalized (IDN) hosts, that same value is also passed to the
#'   domain-filtering step so its comparisons stay consistent with the cleaned
#'   node keys. (Registrable-domain matching is encoding-independent, so this
#'   only matters if host-level filtering is involved.)
#' @param self_loops A character string specifying how to handle self-loops.
#'   Either "drop" (default) or "keep".
#' @param drop_isolates_flag Logical, whether to drop isolated nodes before
#'   PageRank computation. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param reverse Logical. If `TRUE`, PageRank is computed on the transposed
#'   (edge-reversed) graph, yielding reverse / inverse PageRank instead of the
#'   usual inflow score. Default `FALSE`. See the "Reverse / inverse PageRank"
#'   section in Details for what it measures and which other arguments are
#'   compatible.
#' @param damping The PageRank damping factor \eqn{\alpha} (the random surfer's
#'   continue probability; the teleport probability is \eqn{1 - \alpha}). A
#'   single number in `[0, 1]`, default `0.85` — the field convention from Brin
#'   & Page. Forwarded to [compute_pagerank()] and on to `igraph::page_rank()`.
#'   Higher values weight the link structure more heavily but converge more
#'   slowly: a power-iteration solve needs roughly
#'   \eqn{\log_{10}(\tau) / \log_{10}(\alpha)} iterations to reach residual
#'   \eqn{\tau}, so pushing \eqn{\alpha} toward 1 sharply raises the iteration
#'   count (raise `niter` accordingly when using the ARPACK solver). See the
#'   "Damping factor" section in Details for guidance on choosing it, and
#'   [damping_sensitivity()] to sweep a range of values.
#' @param weight_col Optional name of a numeric column in `edge_list_df`
#'   containing edge weights. Higher weights make edges more likely to be
#'   followed. If `NULL` (default), all edges have equal weight.
#' @param placement_col Optional name of a column in `edge_list_df` holding the
#'   page region each link sits in, using the crawler-neutral vocabulary
#'   `"content"`, `"nav"`, `"header"`, `"footer"`, `"aside"`. Matching is
#'   case-insensitive and whitespace is trimmed. `NULL` (default) means no
#'   placement handling. Placement is **not** a Screaming Frog concept: a
#'   per-crawler adapter maps vendor labels onto this vocabulary (see
#'   [sf_normalize_position()]) and `pagerank()` only consumes the result, so
#'   any crawler that reports link regions can drive placement-aware scoring.
#' @param accepted_placements Optional character vector of placements to
#'   retain; edges placed elsewhere (or with a missing placement) are dropped.
#'   `NULL` (default) keeps every edge. Requires `placement_col`.
#' @param placement_weights Optional named positive numeric vector assigning
#'   edge weights by placement, e.g.
#'   `c(content = 1, nav = 0.1, header = 0.1, footer = 0.1, aside = 0.1)`.
#'   Placements not named keep weight `1`, so name all five to state a complete
#'   recipe. Requires `placement_col` and cannot be combined with `weight_col`,
#'   which it supersedes by building a weight column of its own. Downweighting
#'   rather than filtering is deliberate: dropping a region changes the graph's
#'   *shape* (pages reachable only through nav become teleport-only, pages
#'   linking out only through nav become dangling), whereas a small weight
#'   leaves the topology intact and merely stops the region dominating.
#' @param container_col Optional name of a column in `edge_list_df` identifying
#'   the **source-side component** each link sits in -- the template element the
#'   link belongs to, stable across the pages that element appears on. Supplying
#'   it switches on the boilerplate detector; `NULL` (default) leaves it off.
#'   Like `placement_col` this is crawler-neutral data: a per-crawler adapter
#'   derives component identity from whatever the crawler reports (a DOM path,
#'   a CSS selector, a template ID) and `pagerank()` only consumes the result,
#'   so any crawler that can identify a link's component can drive the
#'   detector. Cannot be combined with
#'   `weight_col`, which it supersedes by building a weight column of its own.
#' @param boilerplate_threshold The container-conditioned recurrence ratio at
#'   or above which an edge is **classified** boilerplate, in `(0, 1]`. The
#'   ratio is the share of pages carrying the container on which that container
#'   points at this same target, so `1` means "every time this component
#'   appeared, it linked here" and values near `0` mean the component chooses a
#'   different target on each page. Default `0.5`. Only consulted when
#'   `container_col` is supplied.
#' @param min_container_pages Minimum number of pages a container must appear
#'   on before any of its edges may be classified. Default `10`. Small
#'   containers are excluded because their ratios are quantized -- a container
#'   on three pages can only score `0.33`, `0.67` or `1` -- so a high ratio
#'   there is thin evidence rather than a strong signal. A judgment call, not
#'   a measured cut.
#' @param boilerplate_weight The multiplier applied to an edge **classified**
#'   boilerplate, in `(0, 1]`. Default `0.5`. Note this is a different quantity
#'   from `boilerplate_threshold` despite sharing a default value: the
#'   threshold is a fraction of pages that decides *whether* an edge is
#'   boilerplate, this is the discount applied *once it is*. Placement and
#'   recurrence are two **detectors feeding one graded axis**, not two
#'   independent axes: a nav link is boilerplate by construction, so the
#'   factors are not multiplied -- that would discount the same link twice for
#'   the same fact. The strongest applicable discount wins, giving chrome
#'   `0.1`, repetitive in-content `0.5`, and unique in-content `1`. Both
#'   factors are recorded separately in the transition audit.
#' @param position_col Optional name of a numeric column in `edge_list_df`
#'   holding each link's **position index** within its source page -- `1` for
#'   the first link, `2` for the second, and so on in reading order. Supplying
#'   it switches on the positional-decay axis; `NULL` (default) leaves it off.
#'   This is the genuinely orthogonal axis of the edge-weighting model: where
#'   placement and recurrence describe *templatedness* (and feed one graded axis
#'   combined by minimum), position describes *reading order* and so composes by
#'   **multiplication** -- an above-the-fold boilerplate CTA (`0.5 * 1.0`)
#'   outranks a trailing organic link (`1.0 * 0.2`) with no special-casing. Like
#'   `placement_col` and `container_col` this is crawler-neutral data: the index
#'   must be materialized from document order **at ingest**, while it is still
#'   trustworthy, and never inferred from row order here, where a filter, join
#'   or dedup may already have destroyed it (for Screaming Frog it is read from
#'   an **All Outlinks** export, whose row order is document order, never All
#'   Inlinks, whose row order is destination-alphabetical). Edges with no index
#'   (`NA`) keep position weight `1`, so ranking only the source's main-content
#'   links -- leaving site chrome to the placement axis -- is expressed by
#'   indexing only those links. Cannot be combined with `weight_col`, which it
#'   supersedes by building a weight column of its own.
#' @param position_transform The reading-order decay applied to `position_col`,
#'   one of `"zipf"` (default) or `"rank_linear"`, reusing [transform_weights()]
#'   within each source page's choice set. `"zipf"` gives
#'   `weight = 1 / rank^position_alpha` (position 1 keeps weight `1`, later
#'   positions drop off as a power law); `"rank_linear"` gives
#'   `weight = (n - rank + 1) / n` across a source's `n` indexed links. Only
#'   consulted when `position_col` is supplied.
#' @param position_alpha The exponent for `position_transform = "zipf"`, a
#'   single positive number. Default `1`. Higher values make the drop-off
#'   steeper, so position 1 dominates its page more. Unused by `"rank_linear"`.
#' @param position_floor The smallest position weight, in `(0, 1]`. Default
#'   `0.01`. Decayed weights are clamped up to this floor so that compounding
#'   the two axes can never reach `0` -- an "effectively dropped" edge must not
#'   sneak back in through decay (the same downweight-not-drop rule that governs
#'   placement and boilerplate). Only consulted when `position_col` is supplied.
#' @param duplicate_edge_policy How repeated `from -> to` rows are represented
#'   after URL cleaning, redirect/canonical folding, and domain filtering. One
#'   of:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`"collapse"`}{(default) Destination-level surfer: repeated rows
#'       collapse to one unweighted destination edge, preserving legacy
#'       `get_unique_edges()` behavior and the common binary PageRank
#'       convention.}
#'     \item{`"aggregate"`}{Collapse each `from -> to` pair with
#'       [aggregate_edges()] semantics. Numeric columns, including
#'       `weight_col`, are summed; logical columns such as `nofollow` use the
#'       default `"any"` conflict policy.}
#'     \item{`"count_instances"`}{Link-slot / edge-level surfer: repeated
#'       rows increase transition probability. With no `weight_col`, each
#'       surviving `from -> to` pair receives an internal weight equal to its
#'       duplicate-row count. With `weight_col`, weights are summed and an
#'       `instance_count` audit column is retained.}
#'   }
#' @param nofollow_col Optional name of a logical or 0/1 column in
#'   `edge_list_df` indicating nofollow edges. If `NULL` (default),
#'   no nofollow handling is performed.
#' @param nofollow_action How to handle nofollow edges when `nofollow_col` is
#'   provided. One of:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`"evaporate"`}{(default) Nofollow links remain outgoing slots:
#'       they consume their weighted share of the source node's outgoing PR
#'       budget but pass nothing to their targets. Implemented via a sink node
#'       that absorbs the unpropagated PR.}
#'     \item{`"drop"`}{Remove nofollow edges before allocating the outgoing
#'       budget. They consume no slots, so followed edges divide the full
#'       budget among themselves.}
#'     \item{`"keep"`}{Retain and follow these edges normally, so their targets
#'       receive their allocated shares.}
#'   }
#' @param indexability_df Optional data frame mapping URLs to their indexability
#'   status (e.g., from an SEO crawl export). See Details.
#' @param indexability_url_col Name of the URL column in `indexability_df`.
#'   Default `"url"`.
#' @param indexability_status_col Name of the status column in
#'   `indexability_df`. Default `"indexability_status"`. Values are
#'   comma-separated strings; recognized statuses are `"Blocked by robots.txt"`
#'   and `"noindex"` (case-insensitive for noindex).
#' @param status_df Optional data frame mapping URLs to their HTTP response
#'   status code (e.g., from an SEO crawl export). Lets `pagerank()` recognize
#'   response-dead pages, which would otherwise be scored as ordinary live
#'   vertices. See the "HTTP response status" section in Details.
#' @param status_url_col Name of the URL column in `status_df`. Default
#'   `"url"`.
#' @param status_col Name of the HTTP status-code column in `status_df`.
#'   Default `"status_code"`. Values are HTTP status codes (integer, or
#'   coercible to integer); codes in `400:599` mark a page response-dead.
#' @param robots_blocked_action How to present robots.txt-blocked pages in
#'   results. Both values route the page's throughput to the shared waste sink
#'   (no self-loop); they differ only in whether the page itself is shown. One
#'   of:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`"show"`}{(default) Blocked pages appear in results showing the
#'       authority they collect, useful for seeing wasted PageRank. What they
#'       would pass on evaporates to the sink.}
#'     \item{`"vanish"`}{Blocked pages are removed from results; their own
#'       stationary mass is booked as hidden (their throughput still evaporates
#'       to the sink).}
#'   }
#' @param edge_from_col,edge_to_col Names of from/to columns in `edge_list_df`.
#' @param redirect_from_col,redirect_to_col Names of from/to columns in
#'   `redirects_df`.
#' @param duplicate_from_policy How to handle conflicting redirects in
#'   `redirects_df`. Passed through to [resolve_redirects()]. Default
#'   `"strict"` (error on conflicts). See [resolve_redirects()] for all
#'   available policies.
#' @param loop_handling How to handle redirect cycles. Passed through to
#'   [resolve_redirects()]. Default `"error"`. See [resolve_redirects()] for
#'   all available policies.
#' @inheritParams build_fold_map
#' @param canonicals_df An optional data frame of declared `rel=canonical`
#'   links, with `from`/`to` columns (or as set by `canonical_from_col` /
#'   `canonical_to_col`) pairing a source URL with the canonical it declares.
#'   Default `NULL` (opt-in; the default preserves current behavior).
#'   Canonicals are a **distinct, advisory** signal from enforced 3xx
#'   `redirects_df`: they are tracked separately and audited via
#'   [audit_canonicals()] / [audit_fold()], then folded into the same composed
#'   map as redirects (see [build_fold_map()]). Self-canonicals drop as no-ops.
#' @param clean_canonical_urls Logical, whether to clean URLs in `canonicals_df`
#'   using the same resolved `rurl_params` profile as edge and redirect
#'   cleaning. Default `TRUE`. Only effective when `canonicals_df` is provided.
#' @param canonical_duplicate_from_policy How to handle a canonical source that
#'   declares multiple distinct canonicals. Reuses the `duplicate_from_policy`
#'   enum (see [resolve_redirects()]). Default `"strict"`.
#' @param canonical_conflict_policy How to resolve a redirect-vs-canonical
#'   disagreement on the **same source** URL. One of `"redirect_wins"` (default;
#'   the 3xx wins and the canonical on a redirecting source is ignored and
#'   flagged), `"error"` (error on genuine disagreement), or `"canonical_wins"`
#'   (the declared canonical wins for that source, still flagged). See
#'   [build_fold_map()].
#' @param out_of_scope_fold Policy for composed fold-map entries whose
#'   **target** (the representative a source folds onto) is not itself a crawled
#'   node. The crawled node set is the unique, non-`NA` edge endpoints captured
#'   immediately before folding (indexability URLs are not part of scope). Such
#'   an out-of-scope fold silently relabels a crawled page onto an uncrawled
#'   URL, inventing a phantom vertex (e.g. a staging crawl whose canonicals all
#'   point at the uncrawled production domain). One of:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`"relabel"`}{(Default) Apply the full fold map unchanged,
#'       relabeling crawled sources onto their out-of-scope targets. Preserves
#'       historical behavior.}
#'     \item{`"keep"`}{Drop the out-of-scope entries from the fold map before
#'       applying it, so crawled source nodes retain their as-crawled identity.
#'       The same filtered map is applied to the TIPR prior fold, keeping edges
#'       and prior in one namespace.}
#'     \item{`"leak"`}{Treat each such crawled source like an external redirect:
#'       route it onto a synthetic **leak sink** node (distinct from the
#'       nofollow sink) so the equity flowing INTO it leaves the measured graph
#'       ("these pages won't rank; equity goes elsewhere"). The source's own
#'       teleport prior is routed to the sink too. The evaporated equity is
#'       reported as **leaked mass** in the `mass` section of the
#'       `transition_audit` (`reported + sink + hidden + leaked = 1`). The leak
#'       sink is created whenever there is at least one out-of-scope fold,
#'       regardless of `nofollow_action`.}
#'   }
#'   Regardless of policy, the count and list of out-of-scope folds (source,
#'   target, signal) are recorded in the `fold` section of the
#'   `transition_audit` object. See [transition_audit].
#' @param keep_domains Optional character vector of domains to keep. When
#'   provided, edges are filtered via [filter_links_by_domain()] so that only
#'   links where both endpoints belong to one of the specified domains are
#'   included. Useful for restricting to internal links. Default `NULL` (no
#'   domain filtering).
#'
#'   **Ordering:** filtering runs *after* redirect/canonical folding, so it
#'   scopes the post-fold (canonical) namespace, not the crawled input. If an
#'   out-of-scope canonical/redirect rewrites the crawled domain onto a
#'   different one, filtering on the crawled domain matches nothing (an empty
#'   graph). To scope the INPUT you crawled, run [filter_links_by_domain()] on
#'   the edge list *before* calling `pagerank()`.
#' @param exclude_domains Optional character vector of domains to exclude.
#'   Edges where either endpoint belongs to one of these domains are removed.
#'   Like `keep_domains`, this filters the post-fold namespace (see the ordering
#'   note above). Default `NULL` (no exclusion).
#' @param keep_hosts Optional character vector of exact hosts to keep (e.g.
#'   `"www.example.com"`), as opposed to registrable domains. Matched on the
#'   exact host using the same canonicalization profile as cleaning, so IDN
#'   folding (`host_encoding` in `rurl_params`) applies consistently. Default
#'   `NULL`.
#' @param exclude_hosts Optional character vector of exact hosts to exclude.
#'   Edges where either endpoint matches one of these hosts are removed. Ignore
#'   rules override keep rules. Default `NULL`.
#' @param prior_df Optional per-URL external-authority prior for TIPR
#'   (authority-weighted teleport). A data frame with one row per URL and a
#'   numeric weight. The prior URLs are canonicalized with the same
#'   `rurl_params` and folded through the same redirect map as the edges,
#'   weights for URLs that coalesce are summed, and the result is aligned to the
#'   final vertex set via [align_prior_to_vertices()] and passed to
#'   `igraph::page_rank(personalized = )`. Default `NULL` (uniform teleport).
#'
#'   The weight column must be an **additive raw count** — the redirect fold
#'   sums it (see `prior_weight_col`), which is only meaningful for quantities
#'   that add when URLs coalesce. This keeps the prior **source-agnostic**: the
#'   default is Ahrefs **referring domains**, but any backlink-source count is a
#'   drop-in swap (Ahrefs *links-to-target* or *dofollow-only referring
#'   domains*; SEMrush backlink/referring-domain counts; or even non-backlink
#'   counts such as GA4 entrances), simply by pointing `prior_weight_col` at it.
#'   Do **not** pass a calculated authority *score* (Ahrefs UR / DR, or any
#'   0–100 rating): scores are not additive (folding two redirect variants is a
#'   `max`, not a `sum`), and a per-URL score like UR is itself a PageRank-style
#'   metric — using it as a teleport prior for PageRank is circular. See
#'   [align_prior_to_vertices()] for the full contract.
#' @param prior_url_col,prior_weight_col Column names in `prior_df`. Defaults
#'   `"url"` / `"weight"`. Swapping `prior_weight_col` between additive count
#'   columns is the supported way to A/B alternative authority metrics (e.g. via
#'   [pagerank_grid()]); see `prior_df` for which metrics qualify.
#' @param prior_transform How to shape raw authority before it becomes teleport
#'   mass. One of `"none"` (default, faithful linear share), `"log"`,
#'   `"percentile"`, `"minmax"`, `"zipf"`, `"rank_linear"`. See
#'   [transform_weights()]. Counts are summed on the raw scale before any
#'   transform.
#' @param prior_alpha Mixture weight in `[0, 1]` between uniform and
#'   authority-weighted teleport (`p = alpha * uniform + (1 - alpha) *
#'   authority_share`). `0` (default) is pure authority teleport; `1` reproduces
#'   uniform PageRank. See [align_prior_to_vertices()].
#' @param prior_inject_unmatched Logical. If `TRUE`, authoritative prior URLs
#'   that do not fold onto any existing vertex are added as edge-less isolate
#'   vertices so they appear in results carrying their teleport prior. Default
#'   `FALSE` (align-only: such URLs are dropped and logged).
#' @param prior_exclude_waste Logical. If `TRUE` (default), the
#'   collect-but-cannot-pass class — noindex, robots-blocked, and 4xx/5xx pages
#'   (see `indexability_df` / `status_df`) — is excluded from the teleport
#'   vector: those pages keep the authority that reaches them through inlinks
#'   but are no longer paid the uniform teleport share for merely existing. This
#'   stops a page from manufacturing authority by linking to many dead ends
#'   (Page & Brin 1998 criticize uniform teleport for "valuing pages simply
#'   because they exist"). Set `FALSE` to give every page uniform teleport,
#'   matching `igraph::page_rank()` for canonical comparisons. Has no effect
#'   unless `indexability_df` or `status_df` supplies the class; the synthetic
#'   evaporation and leak sinks are excluded from teleport regardless.
#' @param prior_verbose Logical, whether to emit prior-alignment coverage
#'   diagnostics. Default `TRUE`. Only relevant when `prior_df` is supplied.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to [compute_pagerank()] and
#'   subsequently to `igraph::page_rank()`. Besides `damping`, the recognized
#'   convergence controls `algo` (`"prpack"` / `"arpack"`), `eps`, and `niter`
#'   are forwarded here; see the "Convergence controls" section below.
#' @param preset Optional named argument bundle describing a common view of
#'   the graph: a preset name (`"raw"`, `"declared"`, `"reversed"`,
#'   `"content"`), a [pr_preset()]
#'   result, or `NULL` (default, no preset). Preset values are applied only to
#'   arguments you did not name yourself, so precedence is **explicit argument
#'   > preset > base default**. Must be named in full (it sits after `...`).
#'   See [pr_preset()] for the exact expansion of each preset.
#'
#' @details
#' ## Damping factor
#'
#' The `damping` factor \eqn{\alpha} is the probability that the random surfer
#' follows a link rather than teleporting; the remaining \eqn{1 - \alpha} is
#' spread over the teleport vector (uniform, or the supplied TIPR `prior_df`).
#'
#' The default `0.85` is the original Brin & Page value and remains the field
#' convention, but it is *eminently empirical* — Boldi, Santini & Vigna
#' (\emph{PageRank as a Function of the Damping Factor}, WWW 2005) show it has
#' no analytical claim to being uniquely correct. A common misconception is that
#' values close to 1 yield "more accurate" rankings by trusting the link graph
#' more; for real-world graphs they instead make the ranking dominated by the
#' graph's largest near-cyclic component and, in the limit \eqn{\alpha \to 1},
#' degenerate rather than converge to a more meaningful order.
#'
#' Raising \eqn{\alpha} also degrades convergence sharply. A power-iteration
#' solve needs about \eqn{\log_{10}(\tau) / \log_{10}(\alpha)} iterations to
#' reach residual \eqn{\tau} (Langville & Meyer, \emph{Deeper Inside PageRank},
#' Internet Mathematics 2004). At \eqn{\tau = 10^{-8}}: \eqn{\alpha = 0.85}
#' needs ~114 iterations, \eqn{\alpha = 0.95} ~362, and \eqn{\alpha = 0.99}
#' ~1,833 — so a high damping factor is both slower and rarely better. When you
#' do raise it on the ARPACK solver, raise `niter` to match (see "Convergence
#' controls" below).
#'
#' Both of those papers study the open web. Whether `0.85` is still the right
#' convention for a site-scale intranet graph is an open empirical question;
#' [damping_sensitivity()] sweeps a range of \eqn{\alpha} values so you can see
#' how much the ranking on *your* graph actually moves.
#'
#' ## Convergence controls
#'
#' `igraph::page_rank()` is called through one of two solver back-ends, selected
#' with `algo` (forwarded via `...`):
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`"prpack"`}{(default) A fast, exact direct solver. It has **no**
#'     tunable tolerance or iteration cap, and reports no iteration count.}
#'   \item{`"arpack"`}{An iterative eigensolver that honors `eps` (the L1
#'     tolerance) and `niter` (the maximum iterations), and reports how many
#'     iterations it used.}
#' }
#'
#' Modern `igraph` (2.x) removed the legacy `page_rank()` `eps` / `niter`
#' arguments; this package re-exposes them as friendly aliases for the ARPACK
#' `options$tol` / `options$maxiter` controls. Because PRPACK ignores them,
#' supplying either `eps` or `niter` transparently switches `algo` to
#' `"arpack"`. As a rule of thumb a power-iteration solve needs about
#' `log10(eps) / log10(damping)` iterations, so raise `niter` when you push
#' `damping` toward 1.
#'
#' Every non-empty result carries a `"convergence"` attribute (a

#' `attr(result, "convergence")`.
#'
#' ## The waste class (noindex, robots-blocked, response-dead)
#'
#' `pagerankr` models one **"collects PageRank but cannot pass it"** class and
#' routes every member through a single shared **waste sink** with the same
#' mechanism: the member loses all of its outgoing edges and gains exactly one
#' edge to the sink, so it still absorbs the authority its inlinks send but
#' passes none of it back into the graph. The sink is an internal accounting
#' bucket (never a page, always stripped from the returned result); the mass it
#' collects is reported as **evaporated** mass in the transition audit. Removing
#' the old robots-blocked self-loop is deliberate: a self-loop is an absorbing
#' rank sink that compounds inbound authority every iteration (a measured 8.3×
#' inflation), whereas the waste sink lets authority flow in and stop.
#'
#' Members come from three signals:
#'
#' **noindex** (`indexability_df`): `pagerankr` models the ranked corpus as the
#' set of indexed documents, so a noindex page is outside it — it may receive
#' authority through inlinks but cannot redistribute it within the indexed
#' graph. This is a PageRank modeling choice; it does not assert that Google
#' defines noindex as a nofollow directive. noindex routing to the sink is
#' independent of `nofollow_action` (which governs only real `rel=nofollow`
#' edges): a noindex page always routes to the sink. noindex pages still appear
#' in results so their received authority remains auditable.
#'
#' **robots.txt-blocked** (`indexability_df`): Google cannot access the page
#' content, so there are no visible outgoing links. `robots_blocked_action`
#' controls only whether the page appears in results (`"show"`, the default) or
#' is removed with its own mass booked as hidden (`"vanish"`) — both route the
#' page's throughput to the sink.
#'
#' **Priority rule:** robots.txt always takes precedence over noindex. If a
#' page is both robots-blocked and noindex, it is treated as robots-blocked.
#'
#' ## HTTP response status
#'
#' When `status_df` is provided, pages whose HTTP status code falls in
#' `400:599` are recognized as **response-dead**: at crawl time they returned
#' no content and expose no outgoing links, so they can collect authority
#' through their inlinks but cannot pass any of it on. They belong to the same
#' waste class as noindex pages and route to the same sink; because a dead page
#' typically has no outlinks, this ADDS the one edge to the sink that stops it
#' from dangling and recycling its inbound authority to every page via teleport.
#'
#' `pagerankr` does **not** split 4xx from 5xx. The crawl is a snapshot, and at
#' crawl time a transient `503` and a permanent `404` are indistinguishable:
#' both return no content and expose no links. Modeling one as recoverable
#' would require guessing about a future the crawl has no data on — the same
#' reason `pagerankr` folds a `302` exactly like a `301`. A caller who knows a
#' given `5xx` was a blip should re-crawl rather than have the tool assume
#' recovery on its behalf.
#'
#' `3xx` redirects are **not** part of this class; they are modeled through
#' `redirects_df`. Codes below `400`, and rows whose status is missing or
#' cannot be parsed as an integer, are treated as live. Response-dead pages
#' that are present in the graph are counted in the returned `transition_audit`
#' (`config$has_status` and `n_status_dead`).
#'
#' ## Reverse / inverse PageRank (`reverse = TRUE`)
#'
#' Standard PageRank measures **inflow** importance ("who points to me"). With
#' `reverse = TRUE` the link graph is transposed before computation, yielding
#' **outflow centrality** ("does this page funnel authority outward"). This is
#' the *reverse PageRank* of Bar-Yossef & Mashiach (CIKM 2008), equivalent to
#' the **CheiRank** of the transposed Google matrix, and the PageRank-flavored
#' analog of the *hub* score in Kleinberg's HITS. The sibling `semantic`
#' project consumes this as an outflow signal.
#'
#' Only edge orientation is flipped; URL cleaning, redirect folding,
#' duplicate-edge policy, edge weights, domain/host filtering, and the teleport
#' prior all behave identically (they are direction-agnostic). To obtain it
#' directly from an edge list, swapping the from/to columns and running ordinary
#' `pagerank()` is equivalent — `reverse = TRUE` just performs that flip
#' internally so weight, redirect, and sink handling cannot be mis-wired by a
#' manual swap.
#'
#' **This is unrelated to the TIPR / personalized-prior feature (`prior_df`).**
#' That seeds the *teleport* vector with external authority (e.g. backlinks) but
#' still computes inflow PageRank on the forward graph; `reverse` is a pure
#' *graph operation* on edge direction. The two are orthogonal and may be
#' combined.
#'
#' **Direction-sensitive features are rejected under `reverse = TRUE`** because
#' their semantics do not transpose:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`nofollow_action = "evaporate"`}{Errors. The evaporation sink models
#'     a *source* wasting its outgoing budget; reversed, it would inject rank
#'     instead. Use `"drop"` — the correct treatment of a nofollowed link for
#'     outflow centrality, since it funnels no authority outward — or `"keep"`.}
#'   \item{`indexability_df`}{Errors. noindex and robots.txt blocking (route
#'     the page's outgoing budget to the waste sink) encode forward crawl/index
#'     behavior with no meaningful transpose.}
#' }
#'
#' ## Duplicate edge policy
#'
#' The original PageRank papers define a page's vote as divided by its outgoing
#' link count but do not pin down how repeated hyperlinks from one source page
#' to the same target are represented. The standard textbook / binary
#' operationalization treats the outgoing set as a destination relation, so
#' multiple `A -> C` rows collapse to one destination edge. `pagerankr` keeps
#' that as the default (`duplicate_edge_policy = "collapse"`) for backward
#' compatibility and as the less spam-sensitive model.
#'
#' Weighted / multigraph PageRank is also valid when repeated link slots are
#' the intended unit. Use `duplicate_edge_policy = "count_instances"` for a
#' link-slot surfer: `A -> B, A -> C, A -> C` sends twice as much outgoing mass
#' to `C` as to `B`, equivalent to explicit weights `B = 1, C = 2` and to
#' igraph's treatment of parallel edges. Use `"aggregate"` when duplicate rows
#' should be collapsed loss-aware, especially with an existing `weight_col`;
#' numeric duplicate weights are summed instead of silently keeping the first
#' row.
#'
#' ## Fold-then-filter ordering (domain / host scope)
#'
#' Redirect and canonical folding runs **before** the
#' `keep_domains` / `exclude_domains` / `keep_hosts` / `exclude_hosts`
#' filter. Folding can rewrite the node namespace: an out-of-scope canonical
#' (e.g. every `staging.example.dev` page declaring a `example.com` canonical)
#' relabels crawled nodes onto a domain you never crawled. Because the filter
#' then sees only the post-fold (canonical) namespace, filtering on the domain
#' you actually crawled matches nothing and returns an empty graph.
#'
#' `pagerank()` detects this specific case -- a filter value that classified
#' one or more crawled (pre-fold) nodes but no surviving post-fold node -- and
#' emits an actionable `warning()` naming the folded-away value(s) and pointing
#' at the out-of-scope fold as the cause. This is a diagnostic only; the
#' fold-then-filter order is unchanged.
#'
#' To scope the **input you crawled**, filter first: run
#' [filter_links_by_domain()] on the edge list (and, if used, the redirect /
#' canonical data frames) *before* calling `pagerank()`. To scope the folded
#' graph, filter on the post-fold (canonical) domain/host instead.
#'
#' @return A data frame with node names and their PageRank scores. When
#'   nofollow evaporation, the waste class (noindex / robots-blocked /
#'   response-dead), or `robots_blocked_action = "vanish"` is active, the
#'   returned scores may sum to less than 1. The difference is not
#'   undifferentiated "leakage": it is decomposed into **evaporated mass**
#'   (authority sent to the shared waste sink, i.e. what the class and every
#'   real nofollowed link passed on but could not deliver), **leaked mass**
#'   (authority sent to the leak sink under `out_of_scope_fold = "leak"`), and
#'   **hidden mass** (the own stationary mass of robots-blocked nodes removed
#'   from the results). The full breakdown — reported / evaporated (sink) /
#'   leaked / hidden / total (= 1) — is recorded in the `mass` field of the
#'   transition audit (see below).
#'
#'   When `indexability_df` or `status_df` is supplied, the result gains two
#'   per-URL waste-attribution columns, present only with those inputs
#'   (mirroring how `prior_weight` appears only with `prior_df`), so the result
#'   is otherwise unchanged:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`page_state`}{The page's health/indexability state: `"live"`,
#'       `"noindex"`, `"robots_blocked"`, or `"response_dead"` (robots-blocked
#'       > response-dead > noindex > live when a page carries more than one
#'       signal).}
#'     \item{`wasted_mass`}{The authority the page collected and black-holed —
#'       its share of the shared waste sink's stationary mass. A waste-class
#'       page routes its whole throughput to the absorbing sink, so this is
#'       `damping / (1 - damping)` times its own reported score: larger than,
#'       and distinct from, that score, which answers the "how much did this
#'       page amass and evaporate" question `page_state` only labels. It sums
#'       across the waste class to the evaporated mass reported in the
#'       transition audit (`mass$sink`). A `"live"` page routes nothing to the
#'       sink, so its `wasted_mass` is `0`.}
#'   }
#'   `page_state` is the page's *health* state; the `node_status` column
#'   returned by [simulate_changes()] is a distinct axis — a node's *role in a
#'   before/after comparison* (`normal` / `new-target` / `removed-dead`) — not a
#'   second name for the same thing.
#'
#'   The data frame additionally carries a `"transition_audit"` attribute (a
#'   [transition_audit] object) recording how the transition graph was built:
#'   row/edge counts, behavioral-weight coverage, normalization totals, the
#'   page-mass decomposition (reported / evaporated / leaked / hidden / total),
#'   dropped
#'   data (rows lost to NA / dedup / self-loops, unmatched prior URLs), and the
#'   model configuration used. Retrieve it with
#'   `attr(result, "transition_audit")`.
#'
#'   The result additionally carries a `"convergence"` attribute (a
#'   [pagerank_convergence] object); see the "Convergence controls" section.

#' Detect fold-target collisions and warn (SF-scope / PAGE-rjrduvmy).
#'
#' Computed on the PRE-fold edge endpoints (`edge_list_df`), using the fold map
#' exactly as it will be applied. A fold entry `source -> target` COLLIDES when
#' the relabel silently merges the crawled source's node with a node that
#' already carries genuine, INDEPENDENT inbound links to `target`, inflating its
#' PageRank invisibly:
#'   (1) `target` is a pure link-target -- it appears ONLY as a `to`, never as a
#'       `from`, AND is NOT a known crawled URL (absent from the crawl table
#'       `indexability_df`). This second clause separates the harmful case (an
#'       UNCRAWLED canonical/redirect target, e.g. a production URL a staged
#'       page folds onto) from a benign fold onto a genuinely crawled LEAF
#'       page (a real 200 page that simply has no outlinks -- it appears only
#'       as a `to` too, but IS in the crawl table, so it is not flagged); AND
#'   (2) `target` is independently referenced -- it is the `to` of >=1 edge
#'       whose `from` is NOT itself a source folding onto `target`; AND
#'   (3) >=1 source folding onto `target` is an actual pre-fold edge endpoint,
#'       so the relabel genuinely merges a crawled node onto it.
#' A normal redirect/canonical onto a genuinely crawled target (a `from`, or a
#' leaf listed in `indexability_df`) is NOT flagged -- correct merge.
#'
#' b2 fallback: this diagnostic REQUIRES crawl-URL knowledge. Without
#' `indexability_df` there is no way to tell a crawled leaf page from an
#' uncrawled fold target (they are identical in the edge list), so detection is
#' skipped entirely and the function returns NULL.
