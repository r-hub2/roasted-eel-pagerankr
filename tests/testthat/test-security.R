# OSS Index dependency vulnerability audit (oysteR / Sonatype).
#
# `oysteR::audit_description()` resolves the installed DESCRIPTION and audits
# pagerankr's hard dependencies against the Sonatype OSS Index. It is a network
# test that requires OSS Index credentials (OSSINDEX_USER / OSSINDEX_TOKEN):
# the API rejects unauthenticated requests with HTTP 401.
#
# Scope: hard dependencies only -- `Depends` + `Imports`, never `Suggests`.
#
# `oysteR::expect_secure()` audits `Depends` + `Imports` + `Suggests`, and
# `Suggests` drags in the recursive dependency trees of the dev tooling --
# including oysteR's own, which reaches `curl` through httr. So the gate was
# failing on a vulnerability in the auditor rather than in anything a user of
# pagerankr installs.
#
# Measured 2026-09-10, same machine and credentials:
#
#     fields = Depends+Imports              23 packages audited, clean
#     fields = Depends+Imports+Suggests    126 packages audited, reports curl
#
# (Re-measured 2026-09-24: Depends+Imports resolves 24 packages, still clean.)
#
# `curl` is absent from pagerankr's hard dependency tree entirely. The two
# flagged advisories -- CVE-2026-18924 (CWE-416 use-after-free, CVSS 9.1) and
# CVE-2026-3783 (CWE-522 insufficiently protected credentials, CVSS 6.9) --
# both name libcurl ranges that include CRAN's current `curl` 8.0.0, so no
# available version clears them and no local action could make the old scope
# pass. PAGE-aqnbdkov carries the full measurement.
#
# A package's security posture is what it makes users install, so the audit
# calls `audit_description()` directly with the narrower `fields`.
# `expect_secure()` sets a CRAN mirror internally and `audit_description()`
# does not, hence the explicit `repos` option.
#
# WHERE THIS RUNS, AND WHY THE PRECONDITIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS SKIPS.
#
# Everywhere ordinary -- a local `testthat::test_local()`, the pre-push verify
# gate, a plain `R CMD check --as-cran`, the `rurl-floor` CI job's full-suite
# `test_local()` (which carries no credentials) -- a missing precondition is a
# skip. That is right: a developer without OSS Index credentials is not a
# security regression.
#
# In a job that exists to run this audit, it is not right. A credential-less
# audit job whose `skip_if()` fires reports success having audited nothing --
# the failure `PUNY-rsxtbbln` records in punycoder. A green job that audited
# nothing is worse than no job, because it answers the question it was never
# asked.
#
# So under OSSINDEX_AUDIT_REQUIRED=true every precondition below becomes a hard
# failure with a message naming what is missing. pagerankr has NO such job
# today: `.gitlab-ci.yml` records the OSS Index audit as not ported, because
# the credentials are project variables only the owner can add, and
# `osv-audit` covers the same ground unauthenticated. Nothing sets the flag
# yet, so no context changes behavior. A future audit job needs only the two
# credential variables and `OSSINDEX_AUDIT_REQUIRED: "true"`.
#
# NOTE ON THE PRE-PUSH HOOK. `SEOR-fkvlzltx` names "the audit runs in the
# pre-push hook, which nothing documents and nobody chose" as a defect of this
# file. Measured 2026-09-24, it is not one *here*. pagerankr's pre-push gate
# (`.githooks/pre-push`) runs tests only through
# `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = c("--no-manual", "--as-cran"))`, and no other
# stage calls `testthat::test_local()` or `devtools::test()`. rcmdcheck does
# not set NOT_CRAN (probed with testthat 3.3.2 / rcmdcheck 1.4.0:
# `skip_on_cran()` fires under it), so the audit skips before it reaches the
# credential guard, even though `~/.Renviron` puts the credentials in scope
# inside R. The audit runs locally only when invoked on purpose, through
# `testthat::test_local()`, which does set NOT_CRAN=true.
